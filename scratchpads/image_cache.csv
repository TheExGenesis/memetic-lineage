THE LANGUAGE OF EMOTIONS

...ceremonial experience, but because the movements within it mimic the movements of the first two stages of real initiation. Understanding the stages of initiation (and the ways in which traumatic incidents mimic initiation) will give us a greater understanding of what trauma does to the psyche, to our culture, and sociologically speaking, to us as a species.

**Stage One: Separation from the Known World**

In tribal initiation, stage one is an organized, expected removal from the parents and the everyday patterns of the tribe. Tribal children are brought up to expect initiation; they and their families prepare for it and are fully aware of its presence in their lives. In trauma, however, there is no preparation. Traumatic stage one is a disorganized removal from the known world—a sudden, shocking, and wholly unexpected end to normalcy. The stranger approaches, the loved one betrays you, the doctor comes near, or the play becomes ugly—and it begins.

**Stage Two: A Brush with Death**

Tribal stage two is an organized ordeal, such as a walkabout, a ritual scarring, or a solitary journey. Though there is pain and fear involved, there is also a container created by the tribe and the overseeing adults. The walkabouts and journeys occur on tribal lands where trackers abound; the scarring and ornaments are usually performed by adults who have a certain expertise in what they do; and the ordeal has a definite end-point, which the initiates are aware of on some level. In trauma, there is no organization to the ordeal and no promise of an end. Traumatic stage two is the out-of-control moment of the assault—the beating, the yelling, the unwelcome touch that separates spirit from body, or the beginning of the operation. The traumatic brush with death has no clear end-point"

the successful conclusion of the completed ritual. In noninitiatory cultures where unfinished trauma remains, the psyche will revisit stages one and two in whatever way it can—by repressing the trauma and re-creating it in the inner world, or by expressing the trauma and re-creating it for others. The trauma will be kept alive because the initiation ritual will still be in progress. When there is no welcoming and no validation of the life-altering ordeal that has been survived, there will be no possibility of exiting existing traumatic initiation. The psyche will intentionally cycle through stages one and two until resolution is achieved. In nonindigenous cultures such as ours, we call this cycling post-traumatic stress disorder when it is repressive, and abusiveness or criminality when it is expressive.

When we can understand the essence of initiation, however, we can see that both responses to traumatic initiations—both the repressive self-abuse and the expressive abuse of others—are unconscious repetitions of stages one and two. When we cycle unrelieved trauma through our inner or outer world, we're still very much in the process of initiation. We continue to separate ourselves (or others) from the known world, and we continue to create ordeals in the desperate hope that stage three—the welcoming back—will occur. We may drop into unmanageable depressions, addictions, or neuroses. We may ingeniously seek out jobs and relationships that remind us of the atmosphere of our original traumas, or we may traumatize others. For many of us, these behaviors will lead to therapy or recovery, which can provide a kind of stage three.

In therapy or recovery groups, we can be welcomed into a world where our suffering is understood. We can help ourselves and other survivors make sense of turmoil, and we can speak freely and openly about our traumas, thereby ending the cycling. Though healing often occurs in these situations, many people remain attached to their therapists or their recovery groups simply because it's the only place they're seen in any stage-three sort of way. To stand up and say, ""Hi, I'm Bob, and I'm an alcoholic,"" and to have the whole room be proud of your honesty, to have the whole room respond with, ""Hi, Bob,"" is a stage-three experience. We may laugh at twelve-step"

""...Just like a tribal initiation, childhood sexual trauma creates a separation from the regular world and a wounding that changes the initiate forever...Mythologist Michael Meade has explained the three stages of tribal initiation and the journey back out

1. Being isolated or separated from the known world
2. Having an ordeal or brush with death
3. Being recognized and welcomed back as an initiated person""

The right page is titled ""UNINTENTIONAL SHAMANS"" and continues the discussion on trauma and initiation. The text on this page is transcribed as follows:

""In nonindigenous cultures, that wholeness is not in evidence. Much has been said about the freedom and individuality nontribal societies enjoy, but just as much has been said about the price paid for that freedom. Our individualistic Western culture has grown in ways tradition-bound tribal societies cannot, but we've also decayed in ways tribal societies have not. Our disconnection from Mother Earth and the quaternity is an unhappy result of splitting away from tribalism, yet our growing ability to tolerate diverse cultures and create complex communication systems that connect all people is a happy result. Neither way of life is ideal; both have their healing and destructive aspects. The healthiest society is probably somewhere between the two opposites in that sacred middle realm, but we're not yet in that sacred place. The opposing social structures have made contact, but it is not yet fully conscious contact. Much of the movement toward spirituality in nonindigenous cultures is a movement toward ancestral wisdom—toward ritual, ceremony, initiation, and connection to the deeper currents of life. Conversely, many tribespeople feel stifled and trapped in the amber of their ancient tribal customs.

We nonindigenous peoples live in a quandary: we value our freedom from tradition and tribalism, while at the same time we're drawn inexorably toward them. This should not be surprising since we all come from tribal societies in the first place. Each one of us can hearken back to African or Middle Eastern tribes, to Celtic or Viking tribes, to Asian or East Indian tribes, to Native American tribes, or to the island tribes of the South Pacific. Our tribal selves still live inside us, and our ancestral DNA has hundreds of thousands of"

To recreate this image, start by creating a blue rectangle in the top left corner, approximately one-quarter of the way across the image. Within this rectangle, arrange 21 white stars in a staggered pattern, with some stars positioned closer to the edges than others. The stars should be evenly spaced and symmetrical around the center of the rectangle.

Next, create a spiral pattern of red and white stripes that emanate from the center of the image, just below the blue rectangle. The stripes should be thin and closely packed, with the red and white colors alternating between each stripe. The spiral pattern should be dense and intricate, with the stripes curving outward from the center in a smooth, flowing motion.

As the stripes radiate outward, they should gradually straighten out and become more linear, eventually forming a series of parallel lines that fill the right side of the image. The overall effect should be one of dynamic energy and movement, as if the flag is radiating outward from the center.

The color palette should be limited to red, white, and blue, with the blue used for the rectangle and the red and white used for the stripes. The image should be rendered in a bold, graphic style, with clean lines and sharp edges."
