probably my most radical thought, which I am not yet comfortable expressing in an unreserved way bc I must be getting it wrong, is that almost all persistent problems persist because they are misframed

    [mumbling] you could say, well, we lack resources. like what, in the absolute sense? no, there are resources in the world, but aren’t being directed here, Why?  Communication issue? Negotiation issue? Lack leverage? persuasion problem? Psychology?

        1. well-defined problems tend to get solved and we don’t even really think of them as problems [really? Are there well-defined problems that don’t get solved? well, this is the argument]
        
        if 1 is true, 2 is that we get stuck with poorly or wrongly defined problems

            the most radical implication(s) here is that the way we talk about almost all of our problems is wrong and almost designed to perpetuate those problems rather than solve them
            
            if you’re not careful this can tip over into some very insulting “your problem isn’t real” territory

                problems ARE real, people are clearly suffering, but there’s a lot of beating and wailing downstream that does nothing to address the source of the problem which is, say, a chemical leak upstream of the river

                            if we admitted we don’t understand them, we would then have a shot at finding solutions 
                            
                            it’s *thinking* that we understand a persistent problem that effectively disqualifies us from solving it

the problem with therapy is the same problem as the problem with dating and it's the same problem with almost every other persistent problem that plagues western civilization: your concepts are all wrong + you don't even know how to think or talk about it https://t.co/jZuQSJ7uFW

    it's the same problem with "incels" and the same problem with "procrastination" and the same problem with "imposter syndrome", everything is framed wrongly. it's almost framed in a way that's designed- it's tempting to read malicious intent into this- to perpetuate the problem

                    it's the productization of everything, the Thingification of everything, everything has to be a Thing with some people. "are we a thing", "is that a thing", "that's not a thing"

                        and ofc when Thing eventually betrays you, as all Things will, because the Thing is really your psychic/mental projection, your pedestalization of things into Things, then you swing to the other extreme and be like, oh, everything is bullshit, everything is meaningless boohoo

        I do think it’s good to have many selves – people contain multitudes, coherence is fascism – but also I think you can see that some people are almost too cruel/harsh with themselves in the demarcation(s), and it’s not clear that it’s serving them well

    but when you look for things that people really swear by – for example Allen Carr's Easyway to Quit Smoking – the most important thing is the reconceptualization. In order to quit smoking, you have to truly reconceptualize your relationship with cigarettes, inside out

        but it's v difficult to give people "reconceptualization advice". One, it doesn't really fit into a convenient set of instructions. 
        
        Two, you have to have a deep understanding of the person's existing concept, and a clear model for a better concept, and the states in between

            if a problem seems superficial, but it's extremely persistent and has resisted every attempt to address it, chances are its roots go really deep. perfectionism, inability to rest, etc, might be alleviated slightly with good tactics, but can only be addressed at the root

                and the root can be really surprising, because there's typically fear involved, and fear is self-shadowing, self-healing, and will deliberately mislead and misdirect you away from the problem. you dig and you dig and you typically end up with shit from your childhood

                                    circling back to the smoking example: as long as you conceptualize of cigarette as an escape, as a pleasure, as an aid, and you think of quitting as a kind of repentance, penitence, etc, it will be very hard to quit. you will be tempted again or be thinking of cigs all the time

                                        the way out is to reconceptualize, and see being smoke-free as the pleasurable thing. to take pleasure and joy in being healthy. you strengthen and reinforce this new frame and it displaces the old one

                                            but the thing is, you have to articulate what your relationship with X is, honestly, truthfully, before you can renegotiate it, reconceptualize it. this is where journalling really, really helps, because all the nuance can be in the peripheral stuff that you don't know you think

                        to some degree, if one has some integrity, continuing to mock other people (even when seemingly justified) functions as a sort of invisible self-regulation. it's actually self-limiting to mock others. editing out the mockery will IMO actually liberate you to attempt more things

🚭 For ~15 years I used to smoke ~7-10cigs/day. I’d smoke 1st thing in the morning, last thing at night, after every meal, as a treat or a break, a quick recharge, to socialise, to commemorate. It punctuated my days. I liked being a smoker!

            shitty feelings *about* the cope actually puts more burden on the cope and entrenches the habit even more. there’s an act of forgiveness that’s necessary. many probably struggle to forgive themselves, this is where religion comes in for many (AA does this for eg) https://t.co/LfJhd5Wdad

maybe this is jarring for me to say in context here because i inhabit a different vocabulary entirely but i think of all relationships as sexual to some degree. hanging out with the bros? sexual. drinking coffee? sexual. having a toothache? sexual. paying your taxes? sexual https://t.co/otSIfWaBP3

    the issue is when you have a monogamous commitment to someone and then you *behave* in ways that violate the boundaries of your partner – which is something you have to discuss and negotiate together

                                    the tricky thing about insecurity is that it's not helpful to point at an insecure person and go "look at you, you're so insecure". it's like telling an anxious person to relax. it typically makes things worse. so oblique strategies are needed

sometimes people's formulations of their problems strike me as like, 3-5 layers out from what they actually want to be dealing with. 

you'll have something like, someone who desperately wants to improve their... guitar speedpicking bpm... because they think that's a measurable quality of musicianship... because they want to be a better musician... because they want to impress a shitty friend who was mean to them about being a lousy musician... because they have this internalized idea/assumption about the importance of getting approval from people in order to feel okay about oneself

                                    Louis CK talked about a version of this in his eulogy to George Carlin– he was clinging on to 60mins of material that took him ~10 years to develop, meanwhile Carlin was throwing out all his material with each new special.

                                        there are a bunch of tricky and messy things about the social and emotional realities of basecamps that will take several paragraphs to really get into properly… a bubble can be both nurturing and overly-coddling. depends on the context. i guess family is like that too

                                            Huxley says this about language, you can also see how it applies to peer groups. friends simultaneously provide each other with life-support and also inadvertently hold each other back. it’s tricky to manage artfully but imo everyone should gtfo from time to time

sometimes people will stumble upon a winning strategy by accident, and instead of being delighted at finding a better way to win, they will grumble that the game does not value their current losing strategy

    context: in the replies of people discussing audience building, someone said (paraphrased): "I get tonnes of views when I reply to other people but no views when I post on my own profile", in a tone that imo implied disappointment/frustration that they dont get much engagement

        i'm not saying that it's bad to be disappointed per se... lots of things are disappointing. but the wild part to me is people will say something that demonstrates that they already know how to achieve their desired outcome, but they don't know that they know

            and i just know (lol) that this is surely true for me too, i'm likely bottlenecked in my own games by "missing knowledge" that's actually stuff I already know. imagine going out to search for a rare book that you actually already have, it's just under some newspapers on your sofa

                and then i tell you something like "ugh i hate how all these libraries don't stock the book that I'm searching for..." and I ask you for advice on bookstores etc... and if you're perceptive, you ask instead "wait, dont you have that book already?" and i'm like yea yea somewhere..

                    and if you're persistent you'd be "wait, why aren't you searching your house then?" and it turns out there's some other reason why i'm not searching my house, https://t.co/jZuQSIQrDW

                        "missing knowledge" then is really something more like "inconvenient knowledge", which is a cover for something more like "emotionally upsetting knowledge"
