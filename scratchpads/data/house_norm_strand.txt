        I would argue that "good reply game" is a pattern. It has elements (accounts, tweets), relationships (mutuals, replies), space (twitter), repeated events (replies), etc

                        There is no dislike button, so the worst that can happen is you get ignored. I want to say that the lack of dislike actually does a lot of heavy lifting.

I'm fresh off of a call with a friend and I want to think out loud about something that is core to my twitter experience that I may not have talked about much on here: I want to be seen. I want you to have an understanding of who I am, one that resonates with how I see myself.

    How do I see myself? I articulated much of it in my pinned tweet. Some of those labels feel truer than others at different times. Right now, I feel most secure in my creativity and curiosity. I feel least secure in my intentionality and thoughtfulness.

        Of course, I cannot control how you see me, nor would I want to. You see me how you see me. Some of you extrapolate my virtues and some of you extrapolate my flaws. I don't hold any resentment about this. I also do this to some people.

                                It's great that we get to teach each other how we want to be seen. When this is communicated effectively, everyone gets to decide for themselves whether they want to participate in this seeing, whether they want to go along with the seeing frame that is presented to them.
