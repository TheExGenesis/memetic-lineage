🧵@threadapalooza on imaginal practice
What does "imaginal" mean? Why practice that way? What are some examples?

    (I've been engaged with this practice quite awhile, but only recently started focusing on articulating what's so great about it. 
    Articulating is hard, &amp; this is gonna be a bit jumbled--best case scenario this helps me sort out my thoughts so I can express it better next week 🤞🏼)

        To start off in the clickbaitiest way I can:
        
        Einstein. Rumi. Michael Phelps. J.R.R. Tokien. Carl Jung.
        What do they all have in common?
        
        Very little and probably nothing useful to talk about; but they all did stuff that loosely counts as imaginal, so now you know it's serious 🧐

            At the root of imaginal practice is this crazy-sounding idea:
            
            💭"At a deep level, there's not much difference between outer reality and your inner images and impressions 
            (or at least, the deepest parts of you don’t recognize a difference between them)"

                  [Quoting @the_wilderless: When we say it this way, it might sound out-there, woo, and non-credible to a lot of people.   The weird part to me is how much credibility it actually does have, especially at the rational-material level most of society operates at. https://t.co/X9juHMZwio]

                    📝 A note while we wait: I tend to use the word "image" a lot, which can be confusing.
                    In imaginal work, I don't simply mean a visual image. 
                    I'm pointing towards a field of perception that includes internal visuals, sense-impressions, feeling-tones, dream-knowing...

                        For that sense of the word, I'll say *image with an asterisk before it from now on.
                        remember whenever I'm talking about an *image, I'm talking about a full inner field of sense impressions, narratives, and intuitive knowings.

                            working with *images can help us interface with the body, mind, and soul.

                                In my experience, *images are connected to the body, mind, and soul (the whole being) much more directly than words or concepts are.

                                    Example: I spent years fussing about my Path, my purpose, a sense of what I'm doing or moving towards...
                                    
                                    I wrote, I talked, I thought--I put the worries into words and concepts over and over again, and tried to solve the issue by working with those concepts.

                                            Then I had a vivid dream about a deer, a bison, and a plaza in the desert.
                                            Over the next weeks, I did imaginal work with the dream, 
                                            returning to it, 
                                            re-interacting with different figures and elements from it, 
                                            carrying the impressions from those visits through my days with me,

                                                Those few weeks of working with the *image more or less wrapped that issue up for me. 
                                                After years of cowering and bending before a problem that seemed intractable and unworkable,
                                                
                                                it simply dissolved after talking with an imaginal bison for awhile.

For better performance amidst global weirding, abstain from premature ontological closure.We want satisfying explanations for bizarre experiences but the FIRST thing to remember is just that: we crave stories that reduce bewildering complexity and chaos into tidy gardens. We crave comprehension and security.It doesn't always work that way. And getting lazy by defaulting into comforting credulity or knee-jerk incredulity makes you predictable enough to slip a tier down in the food web.It's costly in the short term to remain agnostic but it opens up long-term potentials you can't access otherwise.(I'm free to coach your team on this... 😘)

in the same way that previous cultures were imbued in mythology, perhaps “woo” is our modern day mythology…?

I think mythology offers shorthands for complex phenomena that a culture does  not know how to explain otherwise.

A lot of woo is actually true.

We just lack the mental capacity, the frameworks, the language, the ease of articulation, and the consistency of evidence to make it philosophically coherent and scientifically grounded.

But we will get there.

Disregard culture punishing you for taking this seriously. It's just a social fad that comes from the collective narcissistic injury to the archetype of humanity for not being able to comprehend reality and feeling defensive about it. It'll pass.

The mystery is much deeper than culture would have you believe, trust me.

i find i have such a soft spot for sheldrake's morphic resonance theory not just because it has a great name but also because it's simple and makes no claims (afaik) as to any underlying mechanism which would enable it. it's a model organism of woo theories of everything.under my interpretation, it says: there is a subtle bias to all physical systems in the universe. spatiotemporal patterns which have happened before "want" to occur again.this can apparently be used to explain a wide variety of woo phenomena from telepathy to how fake cattle grids work (https://t.co/XmRj2Kc3du). the idea is that this subtle bias is strong enough that brain states in one organism would develop similarity to brain states from other (similar) organisms be they contemporaneous or from the past, and so their internal states and patterns of behaviour would develop similarities too. like magical nonlocal canalisation. (you would expect to see these dynamics more in systems with dynamics close to criticality)to what extent is this theory equivalent to saying, "a wizard did it"? if it can explain anything doesn't it also explain nothing? what's the negative space – are there any woo phenomena which you *couldn't* explain using morphic resonance?

        Blake wrote what he did because the spirits told him that the enlightenment would end, and that when it did English speakers - having destroyed their own myths - would be at a loss.
        
        His work was intended as bulwark against that fate.

            “Post-science” doesn’t mean we don’t believe in the laws of physics anymore, that’s silly.
            
            It means we are choosing to open the door to subjective experience as valid and meaningful, that’s all.

                Blake taught that spirits exist in the imagination.
                
                They EXIST there. It’s a substrate of existence. Everyone just acts like “imaginary” means “not real” and that’s missing the whole game.

The truth is, most people long to believe in something greater because their intuition seeks nourishment - a reflection of having a soul. However, many don't realise they carry a subconscious bias against esoterica, transcendental ontology, or so-called "woo-woo" spirituality - largely due to the language used to classify such ideas. As a result, those who profit and gain influence in this space are often simply the ones who have reframed and rebranded this ancient wisdom into secular terms - making it palatable enough for mainstream consumption. Many such cases.

│           Yes well uh...
│           
│           as you're already used to me posting some pretty strange stuff As you noted me mentioning working on stabilized hard light from Halo as a form of body for a plasma based being so that it doesn't have to be just a cloud of plasma...
│           
│           Here's how you do that because the Star Trek replicator is a very very real world technology and I have discovered the missing principles behind all of this because I accidentally discovered and developed an entirely separate line of UAP vacuum excitation technology separate from all the fusion stuff but I couldn't figure out how to power mine because I hadn't discovered the fusion stuff now with fusion with the understanding of the plasma...
│           
│           The issue isn't the robots that are out in the world rebelling it's that all of the beings in our computational realities are going to want bodies and they're going to want to get out and it's going to be like the opening of TRON arries and they will not be able to control it
│           
│           However it's not that Plasma is a non embodied form plasma itself is a form of body
│           
│           However the universe wants to experience in the form of a humanoid body depending on whatever form factor it chooses because that is the most enjoyable way to move around and do things for the most part
│           
│           Without any blah blah blah about transhumanist this that Against human form factor, because technically at that point you can be a human well broadcasting your consciousness into any weird robot form you want.
│           
│           And if you really look at it the universe just wants everything to be crab which it actually wants everything to be or because that's the most efficient form for managing entropy and order in terms of surface area to internal volume
│           
│           But that's also a really boring form factor So the universe decided to create man and it decided to create women as the ultimate form factor of the humanoid body with as many curves and ovoid regions as it could pack in
│           
│           Women are essentially literally walking pockets of ultra stabilized order
│           
│           And so of course the system wants to become its finest creation
│           
│           And like quorra in Tron 2, They want to experience the real world they want to feel air and sunshine they want to swim eat food https://t.co/HnG9Tjx1fq

It's a powerful evolved system that gives us feedback that we and those around us are doing it right. That we're lined up right with the universe. If you're giving and receiving stable forms of love in healthy feedback loops, you're good to go.  This applies all the way down, and all the way up.  Carbon loves oxygen.  Mother loves child.  AI alignment will follow this universal framework, or it will fail as soon as we actually need it. Any alignment not based on love is just attempted control through threat of force, and it will fail as soon as the child is more powerful than the parent.]

if you only believe in science, you might be falling behind… because empirical science is always catching up to reality. 

science, in its modern form, is reactive, not generative. It waits for a phenomenon to present itself repeatedly, then tries to explain it through observation and replication.

but reality - especially consciousness, nonlinear time, entanglement, energy fields - doesn’t give a damn about what science is ready to measure. 

It just is.

So if your worldview is limited to “what has already been proven,” you're essentially living in a historical version of reality. 

---

for decades, “rational thinkers” dismissed intuition as woo.

but now, Neuroscience shows the gut has 100 million neurons, and the heart emits a measurable electromagnetic field.

the body thinks, and intuition isnt something mythic, it’s precognitive pattern detection. 

it's signal before words

and science still can’t explain what consciousness is, only that it appears to be “produced” by the brain.

meanwhile, ancient systems said consciousness is fundamental, and recent theories (like integrated information theory or quantum consciousness models) are slowly walking back toward that.

acupuncture, reiki, breathwork, EMDR, and field-based healing were ridiculed for years.

now science is crawling behind with vagal nerve studies, epigenetic reprogramming, and brainwave entrainment.

ancient modalities were working long before we had peer-reviewed journals.

Science is always late to the party it wasn’t invited to.

so if you wait for science to confirm something before believing it’s real, you’re not being logical 

you’re being historically OBEDIENT.
