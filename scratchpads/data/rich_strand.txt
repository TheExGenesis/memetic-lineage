Earlier today was seeing people tweet about #WhenThisIsAllOver, and this evening was reflecting about the increased sense of meaning in everyday acts from the covid situation.

I think #WhenThisIsAllOver there will be new meaning crisis work to do.

  [Quoting @frideswyth: Once mundane actions are now deeply personally meaningful. Washing hands. Working from home. Buying toilet paper. Doing these things means you are "looking after your family" or "being a good person" These actions now have an intense *significance* that they didn’t have before.]

        The problem is that people are always trying to monetise things, pursue profits, and growth, and these things are just not quite right for community and kinship. It tends to corrupt the whole endeavor. The golden geese keep getting choked to death

        1. how much context do you have?
        
        high context = you’re aware of past &amp; present activities, debates, opportunities; you’re known &amp; trusted by many members

            2. How much spare capacity do you have to contribute?
            
            (time, energy, space, enthusiasm, willingness to volunteer for more responsibilities)
            └── 1464240187437899785 [2021-11-26] @RichDecibels 💜 7
                if we mapped this, I guess it would look like the graph 
                
                there’s possibility for polarisation: high context members get resentful because they’re overloaded; feel like other people don't contribute enough
                
                but newer members have less context so they don’t know how to contribute

                    there’s also the possibility for partnership: new members have spare capacity so they make great contributors, old members have lots of context so they make great advisors &amp; cheerleaders

                        general rules of human groups:
                        
                        1. conflict increases as trust decreases
                        2. conflict tends to form along pre-existing lines of polarisation

                            one of the ways to manage polarity is to be aware of it, and get in front of it before trust breaks down
                            
                            i.e. break the taboos that prevent us talking about these uncomfortable issues, make it a shared challenge rather than a personal failure, frame it as an opportunity

                                            in a DAO or any decentralised network of contributors, high context members have to **proactively share their context**, or they can expect conflict &amp; suspicion

    @the_wilderless There's a way to translate and synthesize between anything and everything that's validly analyzable as a network. Insights from biochemistry, machine learning, psychology, economics, politics and so on can all be cross-applied with the right perspective.

thinking about this community map

this part of twitter is interesting coz ppl realised they could move right, from temporary to permanent online relationships

then the swarm of camps proved we can do temporary local community

now the big Q: how to land in the bottom right? https://t.co/RNN2S4WEHr

Sweet-spot is personal. A place of rational hope, of joy as well as a stretch, of flowering and tending the soil.

            @micro_solid from the 'irrational' devotion of heart, sweat and $ of a few organizers.
            
            There's outsized potential impact for the flow of wise social capital, here. To people and organizations who honor the micro, grok the life-death cycles of community, and don't slap a TM on the emergent.

    @rickbenger not sure how to represent it but periodicity/intermittency / permanence is painfully missing. eg 1hr meeting once, vs every week for a year is a different beast. a cohouse of 10 permanent residents or a community centre with capacity for 10 but 1000 occasional visitors...

        @RichDecibels ya that's one avenue.

i love that everyone is starting to speak the same language now: "theory of change"

everyone's got their own theory of change &amp; is talking about it &amp; finding others who subscribe to it https://t.co/87J2HD6eGI https://t.co/Scf9V0YxwI

    this is another part of the narrative arc of the open source book (that people start talking about what a better world looks like &amp; finding each other through that)
    
    it's already been happening, I just haven't noticed it!
