one way to reframe the childhood trauma stuff i keep talking about is that people adapt to the environment parents + school create growing up and then are thrust into a completely different environment they're no longer adapted to upon adulthood

    in some sense parents + school can end up making and then breaking a promise: if you just keep obeying us, keep your head down and do what you're s'posed to, everything will be fine. that wouldn't be so bad if it were *true*!

        you get a visceral sense of how much of this conditioning people still have if you teach a class or run a workshop for adults. you can tell those fuckers to do all sorts of crap and they'll mostly just do it! you're standing up in front of a room, that means you're the teacher!

            doubly true if you have them do something where blindly following instructions is not a guarantee of good results, eg improv. you can learn to spot the "good students" who are trying to get "good grades" on the task, and i'm calling myself out here

    lol :)
    i tried this sort of stats dump
    existential crisis left me feeling valueless, so i aimed at gaining "general strength"
    
    worked for a bit, but eventually realized that "arbitrary motivational abilities" aren't real. https://t.co/uev7clOCc0

Just saw a child holding an ice cream  with reverence and licking it delicately like it’s the nectar of the gods. When I grow up I would like to be a child

Every so often I think back to the ridiculous grading system I had at school.

A - E meant performance

1 - 5 meant effort

Of course getting an A1 was considered better than an A5. "He's doing well, but he's not TRYING!"

Well, good! What good would looking like I'm trying do?

    "you must try to think, you must try to pay attention!"
    
    no, actually, these things happen in spite of any trying, not because of it
    
    trying interferes, in fact, because the part of me that tries isn't the part of me that actually thinks or pays attention

        this is one of the most important things in life to unlearn of course
        
        but if the illusion is too strong you have no other way to get rid of it than to try not to try
        
        and then you are lost, until one day you see that cessation of trying is quite different from trying not to try

            it's the *cessation of trying* that I teach
            
            and it's funny to reflect on how easy it is to forget that simple move of "stop trying"
            
            I got trapped, my fellow AT trainees got stuck, etc

it's not exactly as if undoing social conditioning is a pure good. it's more that obeying social conditioning is your end of keeping up the social contract, and insofar as the social contract sucks, undoing social conditioning is a prerequisite to renegotiating it

Because of the way the human mind works (see below) active injunctions are much better to formulate negatively, than positively (“Thou shall not” ~ “All not prohibited is allowed” - empowering - while “Thou shall” ~ “All is prohibited except what is allowed” - disabling -.) https://t.co/TW25qdneW1

                                            The lower jhanas have to happen first because your vasomuscular system is busy trying to reduce local prediction error. As you point it inwards &amp; recruit it into helping create global waves, it helps then ‘gets out of the way’. The pleasure becomes more refined

                                                I.e. you can’t jump into upper jhanas directly because your attention is external, vasomuscular system is busy, and neural system is noisy. Solution: point your busybody vasomuscular system inwards by predicting a certain sort of pleasure; as it succeeds it attenuates itselfhttps://t.co/e5RzoqPUnz

                                                    I’ve written before that each jhana is like a new phase of matter — and such phase shifts will change system resonant frequencies. But with the vasomuscular system quiet and everything so close to criticality, the system can immediately snap to the new rhythmhttps://t.co/jdik8ncD9Ghttps://t.co/xwcnuXnY7i

                                                        The higher the jhana, the quieter the vasomuscular system; insofar as we can distinguish neural vs vasomuscular events on EEG we can test this. I’m optimistic that this distinction is very amenable to ML/LLM analysis because the ‘attack envelope’ will be different

                    so, as real wages grow, you must ensure that the share of gdp from industries that are best at being "out to get you" also grow fast.you want to foster more of a sense that if you don't attempt income maximization catastrophe could hit

                            unclear to me if this is real, also this feels rather conspiratorial. buuut - this is imo a good case for why, eg: non-nationalized health insurance might improve growth, even if nationalized health insurance may seem pareto optimal in terms of {care, money spent}

I have a pet peeve for parenting advice that phrases things as "allowing" kids to do things but is actually restricting kids from doing things. Make no mistake. The honest headline here is "force kids to be bored."

                    @vivian_belenky Cartoons get old after a while. She almost never turns down an opportunity to get up if someone will play with her. Part of having unlimited access is that she knows the screen will be there when she's done, so she's not desperate for it like other kids

                        @wfenza Hm that tracks with my childhood memories--my cartoon splurge was a direct result of not having access to any good cartoons except during special occasions up until my parents got directv and I went nuts for it

                                @wfenza @vivian_belenky This doesn’t seem true on the margins I’m operating on. Refusing to help my 2yo watch TV when he’s bored often leads to him happily doing something else, in cases where turning it on leads to increasingly cranky demands to find a show he likes better.

when I was a kid I would ask for an ice cream outing, and depending on her mood my mom would either cheerfully agree or scold me for wanting/suggesting it. this was a kind of annoying trait I didn't mind too much, but I also see myself accidentally doing this and I'd like to not

sometimes i think

"what if... what if i dont brush my teeth tonight? what if i  go to bed without brushing my teeth?"

and i get drunk with excitement at the possibility of such freedom, the ultimate rebellion, the forbidden fruit... and then i never do it

could tonight be it?

just went and got coffee and there were a couple young kids (~2 & ~5ish?) there w their parents; a song came on they liked and they immediately leapt up and started dancing,

and my first impression was the whole 'kids are so free and uninhibited, they just get up and dance' thing,,

and then i noticed how that thought felt automatic-habitual, and not from presence, so I dropped into Presence,

and actually Saw the kids dancing and realized that train of thought is bullshit in a lot of ways I haven't seen people talk about before? 

Like, kids aren't these free-flowing uninhibited streams of energy before society taught them how to behave,

their movements were jerky, stiff, they were clearly locked up in a lot of their torso and limbs, their attention laser-focused on how their parents were responding and re-adjusting their movements around that,

they were just as anxious and locked-up as a lot of adults, just in a very different orientation, an orientation aimed entirely at trying to pull approval from their parents, rather than to avoid disapproval from strangers

Parental "suppression" of kids is a thing. 

But this might take the cake for the ultimate example.

after becoming a parent i subconsciously classified everyone i know into "trust to watch my kids," "trust only with direct supervision," and "you will never meet my children"

fairly stressful when latter two groups include family

        are you incapable of not being on drugs or not talking about sex in front of kids. or do you have an Agenda about how to raise kids that you feel obligated to impose on mine

            @eigenrobot true sex people do not limit opportunities w parents by being weird around their kids
            
            ergo someone that desires to talk about sex around kids should not be trusted regarding sex
