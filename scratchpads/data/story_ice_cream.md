# Strand history: "If you manage to control yourself, there will be ice cream"

## Before the tweet

As a backdrop, we start with tweets from @QiaochuYuan, a long-time critic of the authority-deference taught by the education system.

---

**@QiaochuYuan**  
*2019-12-15*

> in some sense parents + school can end up making and then breaking a promise: if you just keep obeying us, keep your head down and do what you're s'posed to, everything will be fine. that wouldn't be so bad if it were *true*!

**@QiaochuYuan**  
*2019-12-15*

> you get a visceral sense of how much of this conditioning people still have if you teach a class or run a workshop for adults. you can tell those fuckers to do all sorts of crap and they'll mostly just do it! you're standing up in front of a room, that means you're the teacher!

## Root tweet thread: two layers of interpretation

---

**@RomeoStevens76**  
*2021-11-01*

> "If you manage to control yourself there will be ice cream" said the parent.
>
> "I sure hope this doesn't have unforeseen lifelong consequences" thought the child, doing their best to physically tense the body in the higher ice cream probability shape.

---

This tweet comes in layers, and different insights can be seen depending on how you look at it.

A first interpretation looks like this rephrasing: "Children learn to obey, leading to self-control through tension. This makes them unable to listen to their emotions or inner voices. It creates adults that are deferring to authorities, unable to listen to their needs or aspirations, and eventually leads to the inability to take care of their mental health, stress, tension, and lack of meaning." (something closer to QiaochuYuan's previous tweets).

However, this doesn't incorporate the end of the tweet "physically tense the body in the higher ice cream probability shape", which is the more intriguing part of the tweet. What does this part add that is not captured in the previous naive interpretation?

In response to the thread (spread over years), some people disagree with the message. However, they all fall back on the naive interpretation and do not engage with the last part of the message.

> @RomeoStevens76 I mean aren't the lifetime consequences of taking on the challenge of self discipline likely highly positive?

Others like Nick Cammarata (with deep meditation experience) seem instead to focus on the "higher ice cream probability shape", turning it into a neat illustration.

The child has a peaceful, meditative expression. The overall aesthetic is gentle and dreamlike.]()

What is meant by this "higher ice cream probability shape"?

## After the tweet: quotes explaining the tweet

### Trying not to try VS not trying

Several quote tweets in the aftermath of the OP are unpacking the insight. Maybe the clearest story (though not explaining the whole content) is told by the series of threads from @m_ashcroft

First, in November 2021, a few days after the OP, where they unpack the difference between trying not to try, and cessation of trying.

---

The tense your body into a high ice cream probability shape happens unconsciously, automatically, like the reaction of "trying not to try" when we really want to get to a point where you cease to try.

### Broken consequentialism

Later, @m_ashcroft continues a year later with this tweet (part of a longer thread on the same topic):

---

**@m_ashcroft**  
*2022-09-27*

> Once again thinking back to when I noticed some part of me that was convinced it needed to 'do' the world, as if it had taken on responsibility and burden for the ongoing existence of everything

---

The problem is broken consequentialist thinking. Tensing your body has always been used to bring about the thing desired, so it becomes reinforced over and over as the mechanism through which things get obtained in the world. Bringing tons of unnecessary body tension and numbness as an adult.

This pattern comes from an overgeneralization of a genuine pattern. We tend to manipulate the world by acting and moving, tensing our muscles to interact with tools and achieve goals. So our inner world is wired to think of "getting a certain outcome" through the contraction of muscles.

### The vaso-computation model

This speculative model, inspired by the active inference paradigm, goes a step further in the explanation. Here, contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a mechanism to lock certain neural patterns to diminish prediction error.

**@johnsonmxe**  
*2024-06-17*

> I wrote about the computational role of the vasomuscular system last year. Basically, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) shake nearby neurons when they get stuck in ambivalence, and clench to freeze nearby neural patterns https://t.co/vzGxzCVukw

**@johnsonmxe**  
*2024-06-17*

> Usually this muscle contraction logic is highly local. VSMCs essentially act as busybody micromanagers of nearby neurons: a little more blood *here* & a little more tension *there*, and prediction error goes down… https://t.co/205pbA3nRw

---

**@johnsonmxe**  
*2024-06-17*

> A great example of this system is how muscles focus our eyes by micro-adjustments in tension — probably something similar happens in lots of tissues. The primary task of VSMCs is to contract, release, & clench in a way that minimizes prediction error https://t.co/XCb1s2Jr5T

> Human imagination (and thus tension) is roughly the most powerful force in the universe: if we imagine something, we slowly reorganize our bodies, families, & civilizations to expect and conjure it — whether it's good or bad

---

Imagination implemented through tension is the way we manifest things in the world, at a neuronal level, individual level, and ultimately collective model (more on that later).

## Poetic interlude: what ice cream could be

Ahead of the tweet, the semantic match gifts us with this delightful description of the bliss that could come with licking an ice cream.

---

**@visakanv**  
*2020-08-13*

> Just saw a child holding an ice cream with reverence and licking it delicately like it's the nectar of the gods. When I grow up I would like to be a child

---

We also have @nosilverv's that digs into the metaphor layers, describing the other path that the child could take instead of tension.

---

**@nosilverv** *(quoting the OP)*  
*2024-02-15*

> This analogy has layers bc undoing or dissolving that tension - the best strategy you had as a child - feels exactly like being an ice-cream ball, melting away on a hot summer day… https://t.co/TW25qdneW1

## Healing from tension

Many instances of quote tweets are part of threads related to the healing process. How to get out of this tension? How to get to a fluid relationship with expectations from the section above?

### Jhanas

From the vaso-computation model. Heading the VSMC towards harmony instead of tension.

---

**@johnsonmxe**  
*2024-06-17*

> Jhanas repurpose this system by pointing it at predicting (creating) internal harmony. "There is a warm and pleasant feeling here." Now your VSMCs' job is to make that true. The most effective way to instantiate this is coordinated waves traveling through the body's muscles

### TRE and psychedelics

**@RichDecibels**  
*2023-01-03*

---

The hypothesis here is to stop building up body tension by releasing it through movement, trembling, enabled by psychedelics. Releasing the tensions in the form of movements would also relax the clinging of expectations about the world that comes from trauma.

This notion of "trauma from forcing your inner animal" is also corroborated by @danallison's drawing.

---

*2024-08-18*

> I made this drawing about 20 years ago after having a dream about a kid running around screaming I AM AN ANIMAL! This animal child character has recently demanded my attention again. I'm writing this 🧵 to process and to share whatever insights it yields. https://t.co/RyC5KEkvAG

![A black ink sketch on cream/beige paper showing an abstract, chaotic composition. In the center-left area, handwritten text reads "I am an animal" in a childlike scrawl. The drawing features circular scribbles, energetic scratchy lines radiating outward, small geometric shapes, dots, and abstract forms suggesting contained explosive energy. A dark concentrated mass appears in the upper right. The overall impression is of raw, primal energy being expressed or contained, mixing childlike drawing style with more deliberate abstract marks.]()

### Alexander technique

The goal here is to cultivate curious awareness of the tension that arises in certain circumstances, developing a space between the stimulus and our reaction to go out of automatic modes.

### The fall of parental figures

In a semantically related tweet, we get this story from @forshaper describing how the fall of their parental figures because of unfortunate life events turned beneficial for them as a child. The absence of parental pressure gave room for the kid to grow their own self-confidence and self-listening skills.

*2022-08-09*

> My mother spiraled into a deep depression late in my childhood, around the same time that my father's health and career took a dive. I am very grateful that this happened today, since these things gave me freedom to explore.

> If everything had gone as planned, my parents would have found ways to stop my exploration, and it might've been decades before I learned to explore on my own, to wander and deal with the consequences of my actions.

## Collectively "shaping into high probability state"

As foreshadowed by the vaso computation model thread, the consequences are not happening just at the individual level, but the sum of individual tension manifests at a societal scale.

This theme is re-taken in various contexts. @__venki__ emphasizing the tension as a mechanism needed for capitalist mindless growth.
