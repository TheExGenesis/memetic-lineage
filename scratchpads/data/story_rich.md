# Story: A community's hosting capacity as a measure of growing agency

We started with Rich's map of hosting capacity as a measure of agency.

![A hand-drawn 2D chart titled "Hosting Capacity as a Measure of Agency". X-axis: "Duration of commitment" ranging from 15min to 3y (logarithmic scale: 15min, 1h, 3h, 1d, 3d, 1w, 1mo, 3mo, 1y, 3y). Y-axis: "Group size" ranging from 5 to 500 (logarithmic scale: 5, 15, 50, 150, 500). Plot points show different community formats positioned by size and duration: "conversation" (bottom-left, ~5 people, 15min), "boardgame" (~15 people, 15min-1h), "dinner party" (~5 people, 1-3h), "workshop" (~15 people, 1h), "course" (~15-50 people, 3h), "peer pod" (~15 people, 1d), "meetup" (~5 people, 3d), "camp" (~50 people, 3d), "retreat" (~15-50 people, 3d-1w), "festival" (~150 people, 3d), "coliving residency" (~15-50 people, 1mo), "coliving house" (~15 people, 1y), "congregation/hood" (~150 people, 1y), "coliving neighbourhood" (~500 people, 3y, top-right corner)]()

As a highly quoted tweet, this one was right at the center of a rich story of increasing agency:

- Around Covid19, we see talk of an opportunity for systems change and organizing online communities
- Then about moving events from online to IRL
- Then we see the original tweet and its surrounding discourse about growing events in duration and number of people
- Finally we have people quote-tweeting with examples of events they ran and applying the principles from the original post.

*Alexandre starts writing around here*

It turns out, this tweet is right at the center of a strand that starts with a vision on the potential of vulnerable scenes, mapping the territory on how these scenes are built (where this tweet is), and finishes in concretizing this vision with actual projects in the real world of increasing scale.

This map acts now as an actual map where community organizers put their successes as they slowly climb to the top right corner!

Here is the story told from the tweet we found by picking 20 tweets.

## Aspiration

The story starts during Covid, where the proto-TPOT community starts organizing online to catalyse the impact of the crisis into a lasting system change. At this point the vocabulary is vague, people probably have more intuition about what kind of system change, but it would take work to spell it out clearly.

The first bite at clarifying the vision comes from VisakanV with this famous meme.

The dominoes are labeled from smallest to largest: "love + curiosity" (smallest), "friendly ambitious nerds", "high-trust + high-openness scene of exploration", "nourishing and supportive meta-scenes", "shift in global consciousness", "golden age for humanity" (largest). The image suggests that small beginnings (love and curiosity) can cascade into civilizational transformation through intermediate social structures.]()

The key question here is "How do we create these scenes?" How can we sustain new places for culture to emerge that don't get captured by extractive dynamics?

## Mapping

One year later, we started seeing in the strand the first hand-drawn charts from Rich. He has been thinking about how to catalyse healthy communities for a while now, and his ideas start to be more concrete.

The first maps are not directly about scaling up, and global impact, but focused on understanding the dynamics at play within a group.

Two years later, Covid has passed, the TPOT movement is blooming, and we are well after the first vibecamp. At this time, our strand shows the first tpot community builder conference bringing community builders together! This marks the first step in making the vision concretely visible in the strand. Of course, many things were happening in parallel that were not visible. For instance, the first Vibecamp happened the year before.

The same year, in 2023, we got another map from Rich. This time, it clearly tries to lay directions to *scale* communities. Turning the fluffy vision of "productive cultural scene" into a goal community builders can start executing on.

Fractal NYC, who perfectly matches this "most desirable option" tweet is conspicuously missing from our set of tweets.

In parallel we have a thread from @octopusyarn that riffs on how different models of communities can serve different functions. In the same thread, they name the three missing factors for community building: economics, governance (ie. membrane management), and protection against failure modes like cults, power grabs or ossification.

By now, we're at the final stage of map-making where the background conceptual work is solid enough that we can draw a red cross on it and say "this is where we go now!". It channeled the existing traction from the success of organizing camps. The map says that no, the answer is not to run *more* camps, but to scale up in terms of time commitment and/or group size.

And well beyond the map, the thread gives a set of building blocks for community builders. Almost mantras to repeat along the way, as you climb on the top right corner.

One thing I like about this tweet is that it points a way out of apocalyptic thinking. In the subtext, there is the EA movement that relies on consequentialist reasoning to jump straight to working top-down at max leverage, taking on missions that aim to steer humanity away from technological self-destruction. Rich says, first there is a way out from the stable equilibrium of apocalyptic thinking. "Apocalyptic thinking stems from psychological pain, the cure for this pain is good company".

Second, jumping straight to the large scale without experience on the small scale is a "mega problem".

[Microsolidarity](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/) is also conspicuously missing! This could be addressed by including user summaries for the most active users in a strand. Rich's summary would include something about microsolidarity for sure and Tyler's would include something about Fractal NYC.

## Burst

The map and its thread became instant bangers. The map got directly turned into execution, where people started putting their events directly on it.

It's not that the map captured all the relevant dimensions, but it captured the most concrete axis, to start looking at the horizon and feel "that's how far things can go!".

Among the missing directions discussed:

- The periodicity/permanance/intensity of the event. E.g. the difference between 1hr meeting once, vs every week for a year.
- "Increased synergy/flow/intimacy/epicness among a group of 20-for-a-week or 5-for-a-day" from @Malcom_Ocean in another thread.
- @christineist says
  - depth/creativity
  - doesn't speak to how you may want to specialize instead of scale
  - consistency/volumeZ/cadence
  - sense of ecosystem— it's not enjoyable if everyone is making a coliving neighborhood

But the general direction is now clear: top right corner.

## Execution

From then on, most of the activity in the strand came from quote tweets that refer to Rich's maps in response to announcements for real-world events. The momentum from online connection, the short-term camps turned into real long term neighbourhoods that support thriving scenes holding vulnerability, curiosity, arts, friendship, and beauty!

Here with Rich himself announcing his opening.

Of course these are only a few real-world projects. Not included here are all the camps, Fractal and its bootcamp. It would be interesting to dig deeper into how the story of this map and these other projects intersect.
