The passage is divided into three paragraphs.\n\u2502   \u2502       \n\u2502   \u2502       The passage begins by stating that there are two contradictory thought pathways that must be synthesized into one's brain.

Others spent their twenties improving themselves, taking joy in their skills, building their futures and forming their hearts in the very same difficult economic climate; you spent your twenties so terrified of risk and rejection that you bummed yourself right out of the game, and it's nobody else's responsibility to haul you back into it. You are not inherently entitled to a regular wage, a pleasant job, a comfortable home or a willing girlfriend, and complaining that life has not yet handed you these things because \"you still need to work on your confidence\" is naive at best and offensive at worst.\n\u2502   \u2502       \n\u2502   \u2502       Absorb and reconcile these two pathways in your head.

It somehow freed us all and made the services inspiring and cathartic. But solemnity, it serves pomposity.

And so, dishonestly, they pretend that their deficiency makes their views more substantial.\"\n    \n    To recreate this image, follow these steps:\n    * Start with a white background.\n    * Add a large quotation mark at the top left.\n    * Include a small, rounded square photo of a man (presumably John Cleese) to the right of the quotation mark.\n    * Place the quote in a black serif font, spanning 13 lines, below the quotation mark and photo.\n    * Position the attribution \"John Cleese\" below the quote, also in black text.\n    \n    The overall design is simple, with a focus on presenting the quote prominently.\n\u2193\n1318740957408317440 [2020-10-21] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 9\nOne way to think of humor is about playing with frames.

They like everything chopped up and clear. Goo people like it vague. For example, in physics, prickly people believe that the ultimate constituents of matter are particles. Goo people believe it's waves. And in philosophy, prickly people are logical positivists, and goo people are idealists. And they're always arguing with each other, but what they don't realize is neither one can take his position without the other person. Because you wouldn't know you advocated prickles unless there was someone advocating goo. You wouldn't know what a prickle was unless you knew what a goo was.
