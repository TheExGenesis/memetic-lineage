Sometimes I suspect people have it sort of backwards. Focusing on a single self-contained experience to me is sometimes kind of like eating baby food https://t.co/69AqVk4Vwr\n  [Quoting @visakanv: @_jordan_bates \ud83e\udd14 How do you read books other than one word at a time? I think the difference is that books are discrete linear packages, while the web is continuous &amp; omni-directional. Focus is a function of frame; books are pre-framed; operating in the web necessitates holding your own frame]\n\n===\n\n1026294894627762177 [2018-08-06] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 119 \ud83d\udd01 8\nSo here\u2019s how I think I think about it: a book is a sort of prosthetic. A book is a frame, put together by an author and her support team, a specific window, a specific lens, a particular way of seeing. The book is FOCUSING *FOR* YOU. Am I making sense? https://t.co/YJEjlgDuQr\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a black-and-white photograph of a woman framing her eye with her fingers, creating a rectangular shape around it as if looking through a lens.

The hand is positioned in front of a bookshelf, with the fingers extended as if about to grasp a book.

I agree that there are all sorts of things that exist in the world entirely to hijack your attention with lurid BS.

The text discusses the idea that people often struggle with self-doubt and perfectionism, leading them to feel overwhelmed by their ambitions and hesitant to take action. The passage suggests that individuals should focus on doing what they want, rather than worrying about doing it perfectly, and that embracing imperfection is necessary to be prolific.\n    \n    The text is presented in black font on a white background, with no images or graphics accompanying it. The text is transcribed as follows:\n    \n    \"You also ask 'should I be less ambitious, and do less but better' - and the answer to that is... maybe? You've shared a list of things you want to do - you want to write, you want to study, you want to climb, you want to code - but you also say that you're not really doing them. So 'do less' is an interesting, kinda revealing frame. You probably mean 'should I focus on fewer things' - and I personally don't think that's necessary. You can do whatever you want! You just need to actually do it.\n    \n    Here's what I think, and I hope this isn't too presumptuous - I think you're probably overburdening yourself with expectations, and possibly perfectionism. You probably have some vision of yourself as someone who *could* write a lot, someone who *could* climb a lot, and so on - and so you might be turning each instance of writing or climbing or coding into some sort of dramatic project. And dramatic projects are scary, and it's hard to do scary things. It's scary to finish the website, because then it'll be done and imperfect, rather than undone-but-hypothetically-perfect.\n    \n    What you're really worried about, I'm guessing, is facing up to imperfect, ugly work. And if you want to be prolific, you have to accept, even embrace, that a lot of what you produce or do is going to be ugly and imperfect.\"\n\u2193\n1156926821440487424 [2019-08-01] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 8 \ud83d\udd01 2\n@IonaItalia @marktani @daynerathbone @ClydeRathbone @LetterWiki @sukarnoaleman In reply to @sashintweets, who asked about fun, and the nature of knowledge\n\nhttps://t.co/RpHqDSHiFC https://t.co/0gvFOVYtX9\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a screenshot of a text passage that discusses the complexity of personal motivations and narratives.

I could say \"because I want to\", or \"because I feel like it\", or \"because it's how I am\", all of which are usually quite satisfactory answers for me in my day-to-day life. I can construct more elaborate narratives if that isn't satisfying. I could say that, oh, when I was a child, I was delighted by the universes to be explored in libraries. I could also say that I was always a misfit, and so I always sought out connection. People often projected their assumptions onto me, so I felt compelled to take control of my own narrative.\n    \n    But all of these are just narratives, to be experimented and played with. I don't feel like any of them needs to be The Reason. There can be a concert of reasons, many seasons of reasons. I'm happy to surf the waves.\n\u2193\n1157016353099767809 [2019-08-01] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 7 \ud83d\udd01 3\n@IonaItalia @marktani @daynerathbone @ClydeRathbone @LetterWiki @sukarnoaleman @sashintweets in reply to @tim_sandsquid63, who asked about meaning and death:\n\nhttps://t.co/cP58d2M2Fp https://t.co/yshQi2B0e2\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a text-based document that appears to be a passage from Carl Sagan's book \"Contact.\" The passage is written in black text on a white background, with certain phrases highlighted in orange. \n    \n    The passage discusses the human species and their capacity for both beautiful dreams and horrible nightmares, as well as their feelings of loneliness and disconnection. It also touches on the importance of art and its ability to bring people together.\n    \n    Here is the text transcribed from the image:\n    \n    \"From Contact, by Carl Sagan:\n    \n    'You're an interesting species. An interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you're not. See, in all our searching, the only thing that we've found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other.'\n    \n    This has real-world applications for me. For me, the first time I really felt that people must care about me - not just people who are obliged to, like my parents, but ordinary people who have nothing to do with me - was when I first stepped into a library, and realized that the **shelves were full of books written by people who wanted to talk to me**.\n    \n    I felt similarly as a teenager when I was discovering music. I've mentioned that I would **give my life for musicians**, and I mean it.\n    \n    Sometimes people ask questions like, 'What is the utility of art? What is the point?' - and there are many ways to answer this question, depending on who's asking, and why. Sometimes I half-joke, quite seriously, that art is about freedom from the shackles of the constraints of narrow utilitarianism. Elsewhere I've said, if nobody cares about me apart from what I am worth economically, then **life is a prison and I might as well kill myself**. But the existence of art is proof that this isn't the case. I have been nourished by art, and so I am compelled, duty-bound, to nourish others in turn.\n    \n    We are all grunts in the trenches of life. We are all facing fearful odds, we are all doomed. But in the midst of this cruel, uncaring universe, we have each other. And that's something worth fighting for.\n    \n    Thanks for writing to me,\n    \n    Visa\"\n    \n    The highlighted phrases are:\n    * \"shelves were full of books written by people who wanted to talk to me\"\n    * \"give my life for musicians\"\n    * \"life is a prison and I might as\n\u2193\n1157632844258086913 [2019-08-03] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 26 \ud83d\udd01 3\n@IonaItalia @marktani @daynerathbone @ClydeRathbone @LetterWiki @sukarnoaleman @sashintweets @tim_sandsquid63 In reply to @noididntreadit, about DM etiquette:\n\nif you want to initiate a conversation, it's generally a good practice to propose where the conversation could go. this takes the burden of carrying the conversation off the other person\n\nhttps://t.co/riakWZEZvy https://t.co/LmuRorG1FL\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a screenshot of a text passage discussing DM etiquette on social media. The text is transcribed as follows:\n    \n    \"You asked about more specifics re: DM etiquette- I think you don't actually need to say 'how are you doing today' to anybody - the act of showing up is itself kind of a 'how's it going' signal in of itself. Sometimes I think 'How are you?' can seem almost a little burdensome, it can sometimes be interpreted as 'this person wants to talk to me, but they don't really know how to talk, and so now it's my responsibility to carry the conversation.'\n    \n    If you're the person initiating, you want to be the one proposing where the conversation could go. For eg, you can go straight to asking some question. 'I saw that you mentioned X! I like X too. Have you seen Y?' is something that generally works. This is something you can do in public replies, and if you do it several times, you can build rapport that way, and then the person will almost always be happy to receive a DM from you. The helpful thing is to keep your questions small, specific and easy to answer.\"\n    \n    The text is presented in black font on a white background, with the phrase \"keep your questions small, specific and easy to answer\" highlighted in orange.\n\n===\n\n1249446926556319750 [2020-04-12] @m_ashcroft \ud83d\udc9c 15 \ud83d\udd01 2 \ud83d\udcac 1 [(SEED) type=quote_of_root]\nThis is excellent thread from @reasonisfun on resolving inner conflicts and motivation.\n\nI'm 100% here for this.

The diagram is divided into two main sections: \"Bias\" on the left and \"Objectivity & Skepticism\" on the right, with a horizontal arrow connecting them.\n    \n    **Bias Section:**\n    \n    *   **Unconscious Bias**\n        *   Implicit associations and assumptions that influence our thinking without awareness.\n        *   These can lead to errors in judgment and decision-making.\n    *   **Conscious Bias**\n        *   Explicit preferences or prejudices that we are aware of.\n        *   These can be based on personal experiences or cultural influences, and may affect our reasoning process.\n    \n    **Objectivity & Skepticism Section:**\n    \n    *   **Clarity**\n        *   The ability to express ideas clearly and precisely.\n        *   It involves defining terms, structuring arguments logically, and avoiding ambiguity in communication.\n    *   **Intellectual Humility**\n        *   Recognizing the limits of one's knowledge and being open to new ideas and perspectives.\n        *   It involves acknowledging mistakes and changing views when needed.\n    *   **Critical Distance**\n        *   The ability to step back from one's own beliefs and opinions to evaluate them objectively.\n        *   It involves questioning assumptions and considering alternatives.\n    \n    The diagram suggests that as one moves from left to right, they progress from being influenced by biases to cultivating objectivity and skepticism. The concepts presented are interconnected, with clarity, intellectual humility, and critical distance being essential for achieving objectivity and skepticism. By understanding and addressing unconscious and conscious biases, individuals can strive towards more objective and skeptical thinking.\n\u2193\n1839273554090799592 [2024-09-26] @franki3stone  [(SEED) type=semantic_search]\nhmm this has made me realise that even though im putting pressure on myself to \"do the thing i NEED to do\". what i actually WANT to do is be productive in another, more creative way...forgetting that reading these pages will assist in helping me be creative.lets play sum tricks\n\u2193\n1839273727684735313 [2024-09-26] @franki3stone \nlets give my brain something to creatively chew on, and see if i can twist and trick my brain into actually being excited about reading the last 6 pages i need to.\n\u2193\n1839273982870303151 [2024-09-26] @franki3stone \nit knows i want to trick it, so its not going to be complicit like that bot i was playing with earlier.but if i make it a game itll find it fun, so it being a \"trick\" wont matter. all that matters to this part of my brain is \"fun\".\n\u2193\n1839274212399423582 [2024-09-26] @franki3stone \ncreative is fun. writing this out is way more fun than reading chapters on critical thinking.
