They started to vary not just population, but selectively introduced 'smarter' rats. Rats that had better social skills, less temperamental, and better problem solvers, memories, etc. What they found was that societies of rats with a higher number of these individuals reduced and often eliminated the negative behaviors observed in the random assortments.\n    \n    I'd be curious to see these drug experiments compared to the later notions of the original study. I wonder if the 'smarter' mice react more quickly to attempt to reduce the drugs effects.

Some antibodies, particularly IgE, are far more abundant in wild rats than in lab rats. A separate study has shown the same is true in the comparison between wolves and domestic dogs. One\u2019s first reaction to noticing that the immune systems of lab rats behave differently from those of wild (and natural) rats might be to say that we should stop studying lab rats. Domestication has rendered them strange and no longer representative of a wild mammal. Fortunately, our own lifestyles have rendered us strange, too. The \u201cstrange\u201d response of the lab rats more closely resembles that of our immune system than do the wilder responses of wild rats, wolves, or for that matter any of the other mammals that have been studied to date.\"\n\u2193\n936452614585307136 [2017-12-01] @ultimape \nrats tho.https://t.co/rAfDrlggSU https://t.co/PiTApeNoF9\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image shows a text about an experiment with rats. The text is transcribed as follows:\n    \n    All experiments in psychology are not of this type, however. For example, there have been many experiments running rats through all kinds of mazes, and so into little clear result. But in 1937 a man named Young did a very interesting one. He had a long corridor with doors all along one side where the rats came in, and doors along the other side where the food was. He wanted to see if he could train the rats to go in at the third door down from wherever he started them off. No. The rats went immediately to the door where the food had been the time before.\n    \n    The question was, how did the rats know, because the corridor was so beautifully built and so uniform, that this was the same door as before? Obviously there was something about the door that was different from the other doors. So he painted the doors very carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly the same. Still the rats could tell. Then he thought maybe the rats were smelling the food, so he used chemicals to change the smell after each run. Still the rats could tell. Then he realized the rats might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement in the laboratory like any commonsense person. So he covered the corridor, and, still the rats could tell.\n    \n    He finally found that they could tell by the way the floor sounded when they ran over it. And he could only fix that by putting his corridor in sand. So he covered one after another of all possible clues and finally was able to fool the rats so that they had to learn to go in the third door. If he relaxed any of his conditions, the rats could tell.\n    \n    Now, from a scientific standpoint, that is a A-Number-1 experiment. That is the experiment that makes rat-running experiments sensible, because it uncovers the clues that the rat is really using-not what you think it's using. And that is the experiment that tells exactly what conditions you have to use in order to be careful and control everything in an experiment with rat-running.\n    \n    I looked into the subsequent history of this research. The subsequent experiment, and the one after that, never referred to Mr. Young. They never used any of his criteria of putting the corridor on sand, or being very careful. They just went right on running rats in the same old way, and paid no attention to the great discoveries of Mr. Young, and his papers are not referred\n\u2193\n936454539699466241 [2017-12-01] @ultimape \ud83d\udd01 1\n\"That's where double blind studies fall on their face [...] when you're dealing with 3 causes you'll get random results...\"\"As long as you restrict your study to 3 months, you can hide the evidence...\"\"What do you feed the control group?\"https://t.co/aDCgGKkmpsFucked.\n\u2193\n936454790372093953 [2017-12-01] @ultimape \ud83d\udc9c 1 \ud83d\udd01 1\nFucked.https://t.co/o65ZmuUguj\n  [Quoting @ultimape: Bad: Glyphosate isn't toxic to bees.Good: Glyphosate affects foraging effectiveness in bees and fish, leading to poor nutrition selection.]\n\u2193\n936461926598676480 [2017-12-01] @ultimape \ud83d\udc9c 4 \ud83d\udd01 1\nFuckedhttps://t.co/aVWp3WXulO\n\n===\n\n1213026510086393856 [2020-01-03] @VinveliVEERA \ud83d\udc9c 87 \ud83d\udd01 23 \ud83d\udcac 20 [(SEED) type=root]\nPeople who feel constrained by culture will enforce it\n\n===\n\n1278043599528013824 [2020-06-30] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 319 \ud83d\udd01 24 \ud83d\udcac 5\nWhen Jason was alone out at sea for months on end, his self unbundled into multiple personalities. \"It seemed completely sane\".
