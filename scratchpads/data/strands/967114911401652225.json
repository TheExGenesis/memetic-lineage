The passage is written in black font on a white background and is divided into three paragraphs.\n    \n    The text exhaustively transcribed from the image is as follows:\n    \n    \"The 'cultural Christianity' argument says that atheists might not like Christianity, but they like a culture which depends on Christianity. They like open, free, thoughtful, liberal, beautiful, virtuous societies. Unmoored from a connection to Christianity, a society will gradually have less of those goods, until even atheists are unhappy. Therefore (continues the argument), atheists should be cultural Christians. While they can continue to privately disbelieve, they should support an overall Christian society, which they can dwell contentedly on the fringes of. I think this is sort of where Ayaan Hirsi Ali is coming from.\n    \n    I'm in this argument's target audience. Although I'm mostly atheist, I accept that the modern world has worse aesthetics than its predecessors. I think it's trying as hard as it can to push a bad-things-are-good philosophy down our throat that we might one day choke on. And like everyone else in this category, I'm anti-woke. I do hope the worst is over, but I have continued nightmares about what would have happened if the DEI world had done a better job exploiting the post-George Floyd moment and cemented its advantage forever.\"\n\u2193\n1842070852197581007 [2024-10-04] @eigenrobot \ud83d\udc9c 157 \ud83d\udd01 1\nas it happens i actually agree not just with scott's premise, but also with both of scott's complaints. and i had the opportunity today to explicate the same position, more or less https://t.co/J8O0VdFwvE\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image shows a screenshot of a Twitter thread by \"Good Tweetman\" with three tweets. \n    \n    * The first tweet reads: \"This vision of religious truth as something that should just change completely miscomprehends the entire concept, I mean if that's it, then it really is all just made up and we're wasting our time.
