It's about becoming somebody who people (including yourself!) love and enjoy. It's about creating supportive, encouraging spaces where people can feel comfortable sharing their honest feelings. Humans are a social species. **We're practically wired to desire kinship, to be a part of something bigger than ourselves**. So why not get good at it? To be a great friend, I believe that it's necessary to learn to address your own neediness and insecurities, and to cultivate an abundance mindset in relation to other people. Learn to give sincere compliments, to be a gracious host, to be artful in conversation, to always be a cherished asset in any social space you inhabit.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       **AMBITION** is about daring to dream bigger. It's about realizing that you can live a much \"larger\" life. Ambition is often framed as the desire for power and prestige. I prefer to frame it as something more intimate. Ambition to me is about wanting to do more, be more, see more, learn more, know more. **It's about recognizing that your own imagination is a bottleneck that limits the amount of good you can create in the world**. Untethered ambition by itself can be a dangerous thing, but if you temper your ambition with good taste and ground it with a sensitivity to others, I believe it can be a force for tremendous good.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       **NERDINESS** is about cultivating taste and curiosity. It's about developing the courage to be honest with yourself about what you find interesting. A lot of what is beautiful in the world was made by nerds - music, technology, science, movies, books, you name it. **It's a fundamentally nerdy thing to decide to sit down and spend years of your life exploring your interests**. Doing this is a joy in itself, and it's also a great gift that you can give to others. To be a nerd is to liberate yourself from over-preemptively worrying about what other people think. By doing the nerd's work, you will develop a healthy, rigorous and honest regard for your own opinions. You'll find, delightfully, that others start valuing your thoughts more, too!\n\u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   1255774272808607746 [2020-04-30] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 28\n\u2502   on scenes: https://t.co/J0GWGcDiNW\n\u2502     [Quoting @visakanv: one of my recurring talking points to anybody who's willing to listen:   any small group of people loosely-but-truly aligned on something can create powerful vectors by producing public-facing work that's directed at each other  talking about the creation of scenes, basically]\n\u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   1255774927380045824 [2020-04-30] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 21\n\u2502   ongoing thread about the characteristics of golden ages: https://t.co/f0f7HKFx8K\n\u2502     [Quoting @visakanv: Interesting bit from Bertrand Russell about the Dutch golden age, resonates with @DavidDeutschoxf's riffs about conjecture and criticism https://t.co/vfizFuZXYq]\n\u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   1270257245293404161 [2020-06-09] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 19 \ud83d\udd01 1\n\u2502   list of public-facing friendly nerds on twitter in major cities all around the world.

They slip by, in their own private lives.\n    * Isolated individuals, undergoing experiences known or comprehended only to themselves, which suddenly shed new light and understanding upon their inner world, have existed in every generation, and were not unknown even after the Hasidic movement; that is, even after the degeneration of Hasidism. Such people may and do exist in every circle. But these phenomena are confined to the experience of the individual, are not translated into public language, and do not have any public significance. Many have drunk from these wells and many will drink; they have not and will not find it possible to translate their experience, which is beyond the framework of human language. They sufficed with their own apprehension of what was given to them, or did not talk of it at all. If they did reveal it, they remained on the level of translators, without any echo or response.\n    * Source: Gershom Scholem, \"On the Possibility of Jewish Mysticism in Our Time,\" 6-19.\n    * Thus, the Jewish in Jewish mysticism also does refer to a community of record more than anything else.\n    \n    The passage highlights the idea that many individuals have experienced Jewish mysticism, but their experiences often remain private and are not shared publicly. It also notes that some individuals have attempted to translate their experiences into public language, but have been unsuccessful.

(read Tyler Cowen: the high return of raising others' aspirations)\n    \n    I have had these thoughts percolating in my mind for a long time, but I doubt I would've put together a doc like this without having a friend asking me a question that I feel obliged to answer as best as I can.
