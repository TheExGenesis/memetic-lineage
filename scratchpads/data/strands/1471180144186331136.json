The tweet discusses a concept from military/police psychology related to scenario completion and its effects on people's behavior in extreme stress situations.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       Here is the text in the image:\n\u2502       \n\u2502       \"Fascinating concept that I came across in military/police psychology dealing with the unique challenges people face in situations of extreme stress/danger: scenario completion. Take the normal pattern completion that people do and put blinders on them so they only perceive one possible outcome and they mechanically go through the motions *even when the outcome is terrible* and there were obvious alternatives. This leads to things like officers shooting *after* a suspect has already surrendered, having overly focused on the possibility of needing to shoot them. It seems similar to target fixation where people under duress will steer a vehicle directly into an obstacle that they are clearly perceiving (looking directly at) and can't seem to tear their gaze away from. Or like a self fulfilling prophecy where the details of the imagined bad scenario are so overwhelming, with so little mental space for anything else that the person behaves in accordance with that mental picture even though it is clearly the mental picture of the *un*desired outcome.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       I often try to share the related concept of stress induced myopia. I think that even people not in life or death situations can get shades of this sort of blindness to alternatives. It is unsurprising when people make sleep a priority and take internet/screen fasts that they suddenly see that the things they were regarding as obviously necessary are optional. In discussion of trauma with people this often seems to be an element of relationships sadly enough. They perceive no alternative and so they resign themselves to slogging it out for a lifetime with a person they are very unexcited about. This is horrific for both people involved.\"\n\u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   1474969824518410241 [2021-12-26] @Malcolm_Ocean \ud83d\udc9c 8\n\u2502   @xuenay @visakanv @RomeoStevens76 dream mashups recreate themselves as people act into the dream scene using their motor cortex in actual reality\n\u2502   \n\u2502   I call this \"self-fulfilling projection\"\n\u2502   eg a person\u2019s anticipation of being rejected causing them to behave in a way that will predictably get them rejected.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 1471183126449692676 [2021-12-15] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 444 \ud83d\udd01 51\n\u2502   \"i'm trying to be less stressed\", \"i'm trying to be less unhappy\", \"I want to feel less alone\", etc, all same issue\n\u2502   \n\u2502   you gotta focus on where you want to go, not where you don't want to go\n\u2502   \n\u2502   https://t.co/tFaWtEZM1p\n\u2502     [Quoting @visakanv: focus your time and energy on what you want to see more of]\n\u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   1471184620213342209 [2021-12-15] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 135 \ud83d\udd01 11\n\u2502   I think @m_ashcroft would be pleased to know that one of the differences between newbie racecar drivers and professionals is, the professionals expand their awareness and look very far ahead, iirc looking for the next turn instead of just the turn they're currently navigating https://t.co/ifQsEGwe6F\n\u2502   Images:\n\u2502     - [Image #0] The image is a screenshot of a transcript from a video about racing. The text is in black font on a white background and discusses the importance of vision when racing, specifically how professional drivers use their eyes to navigate the track.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       The text is divided into five paragraphs, with the second paragraph highlighted in blue. The highlighted text reads: \"In my experience as a racing coach, when new drivers come to me or even drivers who've been racing for a couple of years, their vision is often way too close to the car and way too narrow and we work really hard to open up this vision and get them looking much further ahead.\"\n\u2502       \n\u2502       The transcript is attributed to Scott Mansell, who welcomes viewers to the Driver 61 Channel and discusses the differences between new and experienced drivers. He explains that experienced drivers use eye-tracking technology to look further ahead, citing an example from the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix where drivers wore clear visors, allowing their eye movements to be tracked.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       Overall, the image appears to be a screenshot from a video tutorial or instructional content related to racing, likely from the Driver 61 Channel YouTube channel.\n\u2502     - [Image #1] The image shows a screenshot of a text passage discussing a video about Formula One drivers. The text is transcribed as follows:\n\u2502       \n\u2502       \"A while back, Sky Sports did a piece where they put some eye-tracking glasses on Nico Hulkenberg. When you watch the driver's on track, the eye movement is actually very busy and this is because the human eye has a small focal point and said the eye has to move around a lot to take small pieces of information which the brain then maps together to give a good understanding of the position of the car and how quickly you're entering the corner. As you can see from this footage of when Nico looks in his mirror as he's coming out of the pit lane, the eye movement of a Formula One driver is very quick. They can look at the mirror in 0.1 of a second, a tenth of a second. During the night races of Formula One, it's always amazing to see that the drivers wear clear visors and so we can see their eyes, it's incredible to watch the super slo-mo footage of actually where the driver's eyes are looking. So here we have some of that incredible onboard footage from Abu Dhabi where the drivers are wearing clear visors and **it's amazing just to see how much they turn their head and how far across they're actually looking**.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       So let's head into the footage now. You can see here that we've got a close up of Sergio Perez, now, he's got his head tilted just a little bit in this angle here but what's important is you can see that he's looking all the way across down here and he's coming through the second part of the chicane, the right-hander, so he's looking directly across and he'll be looking for that apex as he's coming in and as you can see, he's fixated on that apex, gauging how much speed he can take it into the corner and when he can begin to pick up the throttle again. Look at his vision now, I mean, it's so far across, it's incredible. Most drivers, when they're new to track driving or sim driving, they're definitely not looking across as far as they can.\"\n\u2502     - [Image #2] The image shows a text passage discussing a technique for improving driving skills on a race track. \n\u2502       \n\u2502       The passage is transcribed as follows: \n\u2502       \n\u2502       \"So this is the most important and fundamental technique that you can learn to be quick on the race track in your sim, good vision. So how do we go about learning it? Well, it sounds like a very simple thing to do, you just need to look a little bit higher, a little bit further ahead of yourself. But actually, when you're on the track or in the sim and there are lots of other things going on, we kind of get the red mist and completely forget about adapting our vision to try and look that little bit further ahead of ourselves. So my advice to you and the most efficient way to train yourself to look a little bit further ahead is to actually drive round at 70% or 80% of your maximum speed so you're not using as much mental capacity and then you can consciously say to yourself, okay, I need to be looking at the apex, next, I need to be looking at the exit. You give yourself a little bit more room to be conscious of exactly where you're looking. If you'd like to learn more about vision, please check out the Driver 61's University at www.driver61.com/uni where you'll find many tutorials on driving technique.\"\n\u2502       \n\u2502       The highlighted text in blue reads: \"Well, it sounds like a very simple thing to do, you just need to look a little bit higher, a little bit further ahead of yourself.\"\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1471185922997710848 [2021-12-15] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 126 \ud83d\udd01 5\n\u2502   \u2502   also intuitive to anybody who's ever tried to ride a bicycle while looking at their feet instead of the horizon\n\u2502   \u2502   \n\u2502   \u2502   victor wooten similarly coaches bass players by getting them to focus their attention on the drummer they're playing with. *instantly* improves *everything*\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1498611458682208258 [2022-03-01] @actualhog \n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   @visakanv You could write a book based on this metaphor I mean I'm sure someone has but YOU could\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1557547693093752832 [2022-08-11] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 82 \ud83d\udd01 2\n\u2502   \u2502       steer towards where you want to go\n\u2502   \u2502         [Quoting Tweet 1555654118596718592 (missing)]\n\u2502   \u2502       \u2193\n\u2502   \u2502       1644946326738845697 [2023-04-09] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 128 \ud83d\udd01 7\n\u2502   \u2502       \u201cwhat specific sites should I avoid most?\u201d https://t.co/EzhUJZKj9a\n\u2502   \u2502       Images:\n\u2502   \u2502         - [Image #0] The image shows a screenshot of a conversation between a user and an AI model on a topic related to piracy websites.

Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.' That is for all of us.

The infographic concludes by questioning how the economy can be restructured to prioritize the well-being of both humans and the planet.\n\u2193\n1633906019251175444 [2023-03-09] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 1 [(SEED) type=quote_of_root]\n@__drewface @sensefulronin degrowthers trying to draw attention to the thing they want to de-center:\n\nhttps://t.co/ljUFdnQqLM\n  [Quoting @visakanv: dad: don't crash into the tree!  son: https://t.co/dsQO64SLRG]\n\n===\n\n1644578728092254214 [2023-04-08] @RomeoStevens76 \ud83d\udc9c 142 \ud83d\udd01 9\nThe somatic tension we call fear seems to be built from two components seemingly at odds.

The video is 11 seconds long and is attributed to \"Tube/PaulArdern.\" The tweet has received 15 replies, 68 retweets, and 350 likes.\n    \n    To recreate this image, one would need to post a tweet with the same text, include the video thumbnail, and display the same engagement metrics. The tweet is a humorous anecdote about a father warning his son not to crash into a tree, only to have the son do so anyway.\n\n===\n\n1809530954462929403 [2024-07-06] @easoncxz  [(SEED) type=semantic_search]\nSlash their tyres before they run over your kids. https://t.co/R0jOAIZriS\n  [Quoting Tweet 1808876793149206845 (missing)]\n\n===\n\n1818004536805540091 [2024-07-29] @mr_samosaman \ud83d\udc9c 1 [(SEED) type=quote_of_root]\nthis is another instance of \"don't crash into the tree\"\nhttps://t.co/t7uQiX2wE8 https://t.co/QgRE8ePRjS\n  [Quoting @visakanv: dad: don't crash into the tree!  son: https://t.co/dsQO64SLRG]\n\n===\n\n1909824414738264395 [2025-04-09] @AskYatharth \ud83d\udc9c 5 [(SEED) type=semantic_search]\n@visakanv: \"dad: don't crash into the tree!\"\n\u2193\n1909824443221762161 [2025-04-09] @AskYatharth \ud83d\udc9c 2\n@Malcolm_Ocean: towardsness and awayness, aiming in high dimensionality\nhttps://t.co/qXonzzKS4f\n  [Quoting @AskYatharth: had lil\ud83e\udd2fmoment  there is fundamental asymmetry between \u201capproach\u201d and \u201cavoid\u201d in high-dimensional spaces]\n\n===\n\n1921313755410931725 [2025-05-10] @jessi_cata \ud83d\udc9c 3 \ud83d\udd01 1\nMapping out a space of utilitarian views on the Singularity https://t.co/NRuDLSR6qx\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a flowchart that categorizes utilitarian views on the Singularity, a hypothetical future event where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence.\n    \n    To recreate the diagram, start with a box labeled \"Utilitarian?\" and draw two arrows, one pointing to \"Non-utilitarian ethics\" (labeled \"No\") and the other to \"Singularity outcome affecting?\" (labeled \"Yes\"). From \"Non-utilitarian ethics,\" draw an arrow to \"Assume globalized development?\" with two possible outcomes: \"Differential technology development\" (Yes) and \"Agent-preferring approaches\" (No). From \"Singularity outcome affecting?\", draw an arrow to \"Timing focused?\" with two possible outcomes: \"Prefer earlier singularity?\" (Yes) and \"Focus on biological moral patients?\" (No). The \"Prefer earlier singularity?\" branch splits into \"Accelerationism\" (Yes) and \"Decelerationism\" (No). The \"Focus on biological moral patients?\" branch splits into \"Focus on humans?\" (Yes) and \"AI sentience focus\" (No). The \"Focus on humans?\" branch leads to \"Near-term human focus\" (Yes), while the \"AI sentience focus\" and \"Near-term non-human animal focus\" (No) are endpoints.\n\u2193\n1921316633324208562 [2025-05-10] @lumpenspace  [(SEED) type=semantic_search]\n@jessi_cata @s0phyyyy a tree is not the way\n\n===\n\n1922717049979060637 [2025-05-14] @danallison \ud83d\udc9c 3 [(SEED) type=quote_of_root]\nDon\u2019t crash into the \u201cdon\u2019t crash into the tree\u201d tree. https://t.co/qWeQPje3c2\n  [Quoting @visakanv: dad: don't crash into the tree!  son: https://t.co/dsQO64SLRG]\n\n===\n\n1935374204196524341 [2025-06-18] @TylerAlterman \ud83d\udc9c 26\nAFAICT the main way Christianity screws people up is by using the notion of sin (and the consequent punishment of hell, aka infinite suffering) as a fractal means of exerting control, from the level of society, down to the level of the family and self\n\u2193\n1935376190132408399 [2025-06-18] @TylerAlterman \ud83d\udc9c 14 \ud83d\udd01 1\nNot that there isn\u2019t something real about sin.
