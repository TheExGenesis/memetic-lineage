My shoulders are tight. My breathing is shallow. He didn't try to change these sensations-just observed them with curiosity, like a scientist studying something interesting.\n    \n    \"It's okay that you're here,\" he silently told the anxiety. Usually, he'd get frustrated with himself for feeling this way, but today he was trying to be a friend to his feelings rather than fighting them.\n    \n    As his mind raced with thoughts like \"I'm going to mess up\" and \"Everyone will laugh,\" Jamie didn't push these thoughts away. Instead, he noticed them passing through his mind like clouds in the sky. There's a worried thought. There's another one. Just thoughts, not facts.\n    \n    He placed one hand on his chest, feeling his heartbeat. My toes aren't anxious, he realized. My knees aren't anxious either.
