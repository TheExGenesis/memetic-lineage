Now vision, when you're on a race track, is the most important and fundamental skill that you can learn to be quicker, more consistent and have better racing lines. Compared to driving on the normal road where you're looking out for other cars, pedestrians and roadsides, what you're looking out for and how you use your vision on the racetrack is completely different. In my experience as a racing coach, when new drivers come to me or even drivers who've been racing for a couple of years, their vision is often way too close to the car and way too narrow and we work really hard to open up this vision and get them looking much further ahead. In this video, I'm going to look at exactly where the Formula One drivers are looking when they're on track, using eye-tracking technology and some incredible footage from the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix where the drivers were using clear visors.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       A while back, Sky Sports did a piece where they put some eye-tracking glasses on Nico Hulkenberg. When you watch the driver's on track, the eye movement is actually very busy and this is because the human eye has a small focal point and said the eye has to move around a lot to take small pieces of information which the brain then maps together to give a good understanding of the position of the car and how quickly you're entering the corner. As you can see from this footage of when Nico looks in his mirror as he's coming out of the pit lane, the eye movement of a Formula One driver is very quick. They can look at the mirror in 0.1 of a second, a tenth of a second. During the night races of Formula One, it's always amazing to see that the drivers wear clear visors and so we can see their eyes, it's incredible to watch the super slo-mo footage of actually where the driver's eyes are looking. So here we have some of that incredible onboard footage from Abu Dhabi where the drivers are wearing clear visors and it's amazing just to see how much they turn their head and how far across they're actually looking.\"\n\u2502     - [Image #1] The image is a screenshot of an article discussing the eye movements of professional Formula One drivers. The text explains that the human eye has a small focal point and must move around to take in information, which the brain then maps together to understand the position of the car and how quickly it's entering a corner.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       The article highlights that professional drivers, such as Nico Hulkenberg, have very quick eye movements, able to look in their mirror for 0.1 seconds. It also mentions that during night races, drivers wear clear visors, allowing their eyes to be visible on slow-motion footage.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       The text then analyzes footage of Sergio Perez driving, noting that he's looking far ahead, fixating on the apex of the corner, and gauging his speed. The article concludes that most new drivers don't look as far ahead as they can, unlike experienced drivers like Perez.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       The relevant text from the image is:\n\u2502       \"A while back, Sky Sports did a piece where they put some eye-tracking glasses on Nico Hulkenberg.

You can see here that we've got a close up of Sergio Perez, now, he's got his head tilted just a little bit in this angle here but what's important is you can see that he's looking all the way across down here and he's coming through the second part of the chicane, the right-hander, so he's looking directly across and he'll be looking for that apex as he's coming in and as you can see, he's fixated on that\n\u2502     - [Image #2] The image shows a passage of text discussing a technique for improving driving skills, specifically focusing on vision and awareness on the race track.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       The text is transcribed as follows:\n\u2502       \n\u2502       \"So this is the most important and fundamental technique that you can learn to be quick on the race track in your sim, good vision. So how do we go about learning it? Well, it sounds like a very simple thing to do, you just need to look a little bit higher, a little bit further ahead of yourself. But actually, when you're on the track or in the sim and there are lots of other things going on, we kind of get the red mist and completely forget about adapting our vision to try and look that little bit further ahead of ourselves. So my advice to you and the most efficient way to train yourself to look a little bit further ahead is to actually drive round at 70% or 80% of your maximum speed so you're not using as much mental capacity and then you can consciously say to yourself, okay, I need to be looking at the apex, next, I need to be looking at the exit. You give yourself a little bit more room to be conscious of exactly where you're looking.

Suppose that the student is a middle-aged businessman bent on improving his position on the club ladder. The pro is standing at the net with a large basket of balls, and being a bit uncertain whether his student is considering him worth the lesson fee, he is carefully evaluating every shot. \"That's good, but you're rolling your racket face over a little on your follow-through, Mr. Weil. Now shift your weight onto your front foot as you step into the ball... Now you're taking your racket back too late ... Your backswing should be a little lower than on that last shot... That's it, much better.\" Before long, Mr. Weil's mind is churning with **six thoughts about what he should be doing and sixteen thoughts about what he shouldn't be doing**. Improvement seems dubious and very complex, but both he and the pro are impressed by the careful analysis of each stroke and the fee is gladly paid upon receipt of the advice to \"practice all this, and eventually you'll see a big improvement.\"\n\u2193\n1473718498245414919 [2021-12-22] @QiaochuYuan \ud83d\udc9c 21 \ud83d\udd01 2\nhe gives a bunch of verbal instructions to his tennis students and it just tenses them up as they *try really hard* to follow all of them, vs. he demonstrates to them the desired behavior and asks them to imagine and then imitate it and it works perfectly https://t.co/iK140rVjHv\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a screenshot of a text passage.

I was determined to show him how to play using as few instructions as possible; I'd try to keep his mind uncluttered and see if it made a difference.

The quote reads, \"You're watching Futurama, the show that does not advocate the cool crime of robbery!\" The explanatory text discusses how the trope involves portraying a negative behavior or action in a way that makes it appealing, potentially leading the audience to misinterpret the intended message.\n    \n    To reproduce the image, one would need to create a webpage with the same title, layout, and content.

Trouble is, just by showing or describing it in lavish detail, you end up undermining your message by showing just how damn appealing it is and cause the audience to get the wrong idea.\n    \n    This trope is especially easy to fall into when a piece of media aims for a realistic portrayal of why people get lured into things like drinking, smoking, being promiscuous, doing drugs, getting into dangerous situations, fighting awesome action sequences, etc., thereby identifying to the audience what others see in it, possibly causing them to view it in a light they hadn't previously seen it in. Conversely, if you gloss over the very real appeal, you end up with a bad habit that seems no rational person would ever pick up (akin to an ad reading 'Stop Punching Kittens'). The trick is finding the balance between getting the audience to understand the appeal\n\u2193\n1517194282720931840 [2022-04-21] @QiaochuYuan \ud83d\udc9c 67 \ud83d\udd01 1\nnowhere is this more obvious than when people pretend to criticize sex work\n\nthere's a 2015 netflix documentary called Hot Girls Wanted. it pretends to be a criticism of the porn industry but notice the preview image straight up makes it look like porn itself. and: https://t.co/KyRIFXqONY\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a promotional poster for the Netflix documentary \"Hot Girls Wanted.\" \n    \n    * The poster features a woman sitting on a bed, facing away from the camera, with her head in her hands.\n    \t+ She has long brown hair and is wearing a black bra, white thigh-high stockings, and no pants.\n    \t+ The bed has white sheets and pillows, and there is a window with curtains behind her.\n    * The title of the documentary is prominently displayed in large white text on the right side of the image.\n    \t+ The text reads: \"FROM PRODUCER RASHIDA JONES HOT GIRLS WANTED A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT PORN, THE INTERNET AND THE GIRL NEXT DOOR.\"\n    \t+ Below the title, there are two logos: one for Sundance Film Festival and another that is not legible.\n    * In the top-left corner, the Netflix logo is displayed in red text.\n    \n    The overall atmosphere of the image is provocative and attention-grabbing, suggesting that the documentary will explore themes related to sex work, technology, and young women.\n\u2193\n1517194287003291649 [2022-04-21] @QiaochuYuan \ud83d\udc9c 104 \ud83d\udd01 5\nthis take apparently goes back in some form all the way to francois truffaut in 1973: \"I don't think I've really seen an antiwar film.

The comic strip is drawn in a simple style, with bold lines and bright colors.\n    \n    Here are the details of the comic strip:\n    \n    * **Panel 1:**\n    \t+ The clown is standing on the left side of the panel, wearing a red nose and a blue shirt with white ruffles.\n    \t+ The man is standing on the right side of the panel, wearing a black suit and glasses.\n    \t+ The clown says, \"KID, WHY ARE CHILDREN AFRAID OF CLOWNS?\" in a speech bubble.\n    \t+ The man responds, \"ADVERSE SELECTION.\" in a speech bubble.\n    * **Panel 2:**\n    \t+ The man is speaking, saying, \"IF YOU HAVE A HEALTH INSURANCE POOL AND HEALTHY PEOPLE LEAVE, PREMIUMS HAVE TO INCREASE SINCE THE OVERALL POPULATION IS SICKER.\" in a speech bubble.\n    \t+ The background of the panel is a solid tan color.\n    * **Panel 3:**\n    \t+ The man continues speaking, saying, \"THAT DRIVES OUT THE HEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE REMAINING GROUP, INCREASING PREMIUMS FOR THOSE WHO REMAIN. ITERATE THIS PROCESS LONG ENOUGH AND THE SYSTEM BREAKS.\" in a speech bubble.\n    \t+ The clown is visible in the background, looking concerned.\n    * **Panel 4:**\n    \t+ The clown says, \"SO... SUPPOSE KIDS ARE JUST A LITTLE AFRAID OF CLOWNS.\" in a speech bubble.\n    \t+ The man looks at the clown, seemingly understanding the point being made.\n    \n    In summary, the comic strip uses the concept of adverse selection to explain why children might be afraid of clowns. The clown asks the man why kids are afraid of him, and the man explains that if healthy people leave a health insurance pool, premiums increase, driving out even more healthy people, ultimately breaking the system. The clown then makes a humorous connection between this concept and children's fear of clowns, suggesting that maybe kids are just a little afraid of clowns.\n\u2193\n1597915642958868481 [2022-11-30] @ultimape \ud83d\udc9c 1\n@visakanv To whit, find a clown who leans into the fear as a form of comedy to make fun of it.

They must adopt the same contracted form as the hell realm beings. ...\n\nhttps://t.co/0X0Nrtqc7j\n  [Quoting @RomeoStevens76: @realpotofgreed  a bit tired and rambling but In hell realms, most stimuli are negative, causing beings to contract their extremities to avoid being struck or burned. The energy body pulls in on itself and tenses against harm. While there is physical torture, this serves more as a metaphor, as the torment extends across all possible dimensions. Thought forms in hell realms have a more difficult time turning towards helpful things and an easier time turning towards negative things. This is characteristic of realms in general - a realm is essentially an area of mind-space where thoughts related to that realm more easily chain into one another, creating an attractor in that space. In hell realms, there is strong reinforcement of self-recrimination, shame, and guilt. The Christ figure, particularly in its human form, serves an interesting function in this context. While I'm not Christian and can't speak to their specific interpretation, I can describe how bodhisattvas work to help beings in hell realms. A bodhisattva entering hell must first fold themselves in particular ways to be visible or legible to the beings there. They must adopt the same contracted form as the hell realm beings. But then they unfold, providing an existence proof that unfolding from the hell-shape is possible. This may explain why the Jesus event, if it involved a historical person, was so shocking. We expect everyone to fold up when encountering adversity. Witnessing someone being tortured to death without folding up would be one of the most profound experiences possible for a human being. The Christ-shape in hell realms represents one of the exits. Hell often threatens with infinities - infinite punishment, infinite suffering. The Christ figure counters this with infinite forgiveness, cutting off certain forms of recursive self-recrimination that are commonly used to torment people. This is a simplified, low-dimensional description. The actual experience, similar to positive psychedelic experiences, involves unfolding in dimensions you didn't realize you were cramped in, discovering that your true self is far more vast than you imagined. Imagine being in hell so long you've forgotten what light looks like. Then an angel appears, and the demons - who have convinced you of their absolute power over infinite time - flee in terror. The magnitude of such an event is difficult to describe unless you've experienced a hell realm yourself. Depression is more akin to a hungry ghost realm, though there's likely overlap between hungry ghost realms and the cold hells. There are obvious exits from hell realms, like gratitude or helping other beings. However, since these are genuine exits - accessing genuine gratitude or shifting focus from your suffering to helping others already puts one foot outside hell - demons possessing you work extremely hard to cut off access to these paths. Pain contracts consciousness, making it like looking through a tiny tube. Reading reality becomes like scanning a sign piece by piece, struggling to hold the whole in working memory. This is why beings helping those in hell must fold themselves very small. It's also where mantras originate - when you're so contracted that you can't remember the full shapes of compassion or gratitude, sometimes all you can hold onto is the pointer. This is part of why why demons often take over churches and similar institutions - they position themselves as gatekeepers near the real exits while setting up false ones. Once you're sufficiently confused, you may give up and look to the demons for guidance, whereupon they'll lead you into games that create more suffering, which feeds them further.]\n\u2193\n1944084884198207857 [2025-07-12] @AbstractFairy \ud83d\udc9c 4\n&gt; But then they unfold, providing an existence proof that unfolding from the hell-shape is possible.\n\n===\n"
