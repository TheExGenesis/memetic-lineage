The circles should be composed of small white dots.\n    * Fill the remaining space with red and white stripes that radiate outward from the center of the image. The stripes should be thin and evenly spaced, with the red stripes slightly wider than the white ones.\n    * Ensure that the stripes are curved, following the shape of the spiral pattern created by the concentric circles.\n    * Pay attention to the proportions of the image, with the blue rectangle occupying the upper left quadrant and the stripes filling the remaining three-quarters of the space.\n    \n    By following these steps, you should be able to recreate the stylized American flag depicted in the image.\n\u2193\n1668781570033868800 [2023-06-14] @eigenrobot \ud83d\udc9c 11\nan only slightly amusing explanation sadly\n\noh well perhaps we'll always have LGBTQIA just like well always have the NAACP and no one will talk it\nhttps://t.co/8BtpU88nZP\n  [Quoting Tweet 1668697365614673922 (missing)]\n\n===\n\n1668654086181335047 [2023-06-13] @goblinodds  [(SEED) type=quote_of_root]\nRT @eigenrobot: https://t.co/684ONtSHMc\n  [Quoting @literalbanana: sorry but if sincerely defending your beliefs is clearly and easily distinguishable from trolling then your beliefs are basic]\n\n===\n\n1693634263546007585 [2023-08-21] @eigenrobot \ud83d\udc9c 119 \ud83d\udd01 3 \ud83d\udcac 1 [(SEED) type=quote_of_root]\nlemma: if your trolling is clearly and easily distinguishable from defending your beliefs than your trolling is basic https://t.co/684ONtSHMc\n  [Quoting @literalbanana: sorry but if sincerely defending your beliefs is clearly and easily distinguishable from trolling then your beliefs are basic]\n\u2193\n1693641246948933645 [2023-08-21] @Paul_Melman \ud83d\udc9c 1\n@eigenrobot What if your trolling is indistinguishable from genuinely getting mad on the internet?\n\n===\n\n1734027715693474062 [2023-12-11] @strangestloop \ud83d\udc9c 7 \ud83d\udd01 1 [(SEED) type=semantic_search]\nif you can't explain your beliefs in plain language then your beliefs are suspect\n\n===\n\n1739363399706857650 [2023-12-25] @the_wilderless \ud83d\udc9c 83 \ud83d\udd01 6\nthe main problem with me always saying \"live urgently, seek resonance\" was that I didn't put a \"motherfucker\" at the end\n\u2193\n1739363628917129366 [2023-12-25] @tasshinfogleman \ud83d\udc9c 15 \ud83d\udd01 1\n@the_wilderless we're here to renew the sacred, ya little shits\n\u2193\n1739363993439904211 [2023-12-25] @tasshinfogleman \ud83d\udc9c 5\n@the_wilderless how many times do i have to fuckin' explain it to you, mythopoetic cognition is the engine of mind\n\u2193\n1739364606601257187 [2023-12-25] @strangestloop \ud83d\udc9c 7 [(SEED) type=quote_of_semantic_search]\n@tasshinfogleman @the_wilderless dumb it down for the benefit of all beings? :^)\nhttps://t.co/c0sjtO8HF2\n  [Quoting @strangestloop: if you can't explain your beliefs in plain language then your beliefs are suspect]\n\u2193\n1739365797330329895 [2023-12-25] @michelleakin \ud83d\udc9c 3\n@strangestloop @tasshinfogleman @the_wilderless this whole thread https://t.co/UhxXy4TUk0\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a screenshot of Snoop Dogg, an American rapper, in a television show or commercial.
