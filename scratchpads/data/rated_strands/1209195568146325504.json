    "reasoning_summary": "This strand centers on Malcolm Ocean's \"Dream Mashups\" concept\u2014the idea that people constantly experience reality as a blend of current situations and old emotional meanings, like \"dreaming you're at high school but it's also on a boat.\" The arc spans 2019-2024, evolving from a single metaphor into a full blog post, multiple salons, and integration into therapeutic/somatic practices. It's highly dialectical: Qiaochu introduces trauma, Malcolm synthesizes the metaphor, Visa evangelizes it, practitioners like relic_radiation apply it to bodywork. The concept becomes a boundary object for discussing emotional flashbacks, projection, and healing\u2014moving from abstract theory to embodied practice. High cohesion among core participants (Malcolm, Visa, Qiaochu, Yatharth, relic_radiation), with clear utility for both psychological self-understanding and therapeutic application.",
