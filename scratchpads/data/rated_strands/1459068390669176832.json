The text reads:\n    \n    TF - What does that look like - being kinder to people? Why did that become a focus for you?\n    \n    TC - If you can be encouraging in a non-trivial way - it can really mean a lot to people, and it takes several kinds of effort. There's effort in the moment, but also the skill of how to sincerely have a sense of what would be the encouraging thing to say - and it seems to me that's greatly undersupplied in the world. Like some of the things that are undersupplied are just people telling people what they're good at, which happens plenty, but really kind of accurate and incisive. \"This is what you're good at and why\" - greatly undersupplied. Supplying people, especially younger people, visions of what they could be - greatly undersupplied.\n    \n    To recreate this image, you would need to copy the exact text and formatting, including the attribution of the speakers (TF and TC) and the content of their conversation, and present it on a plain white background.\n\u2193\n1389187348420829186 [2021-05-03] @tasshinfogleman \ud83d\udc9c 12\n(Tyler goes on to explain in that episode that that's why he does his EV grants... the money is symbolic, a way to encourage people and make it real for them that he believes in them)\n\u2193\n1389187349305860096 [2021-05-03] @tasshinfogleman \ud83d\udc9c 12\n\"People share things that make them look \ud83d\udcaf\"https://t.co/qUUyJa4K3Q\n  [Quoting Tweet 1387463948312719370 (missing)]\n\u2193\n1389188149016936452 [2021-05-03] @tasshinfogleman \ud83d\udc9c 10\nhere's some of the wisdom he shared with me about excellent reply game:\n\u2193\n1389188149826441216 [2021-05-03] @tasshinfogleman \ud83d\udc9c 15\n\"Reply game is an infinite game, akin to improv, 'yes and'\"\n\u2193\n1389188151072247809 [2021-05-03] @tasshinfogleman \ud83d\udc9c 15\n\"Make it easy for people to understand/continue the game/dance of replies\"\n\u2193\n1389188151973908481 [2021-05-03] @tasshinfogleman \ud83d\udc9c 17\n\"people LOVE to be showered in likes.

The discourse is primarily constructive rather than dialectical\u2014people adopt, celebrate, and occasionally critique these norms, but the core artifact remains stable. The strand shows high cohesion (recurring references over 4 years) but low conceptual evolution (the norms are repeated, not refined). Utility is medium: high for scene insiders (provides shared language and identity markers) but low for outsiders (lacks actionable frameworks beyond vibes). Yatharth's 2021 critique about 'goodharting' represents the only substantive challenge, warning that explicit norms can corrupt organic culture, but this thread is largely ignored by the community.",
