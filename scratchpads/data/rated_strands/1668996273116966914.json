The first seven bullet points have a single sentence or phrase, while the last one has two sentences. The text is written in a casual, conversational style and appears to be a personal reflection or advice on how to approach introspection.\n    \n    The background of the image is white, providing a clean and simple contrast to the black text. Overall, the image presents a thought-provoking and introspective message, encouraging the reader to confront their problems and emotions head-on. \n    \n    Here is the full text of the image:\n    \n    * Your (worst) problems are likely not what you think they are.\n    * If you're stuck, there's likely a good reason for it. There's also likely an additional good reason why you're avoiding the first reason. (It's typically some form of fear, which is trying to protect you. The ultimate fear is often a fear of death/loss, and/or social death. For many, the latter is often more frightening than the former.)\n    * Self-love isn't just bubble baths and spa days, it's about confronting the \"monster\" within yourself that you have ostracized for being shameful, cringe, dangerous, gross, grotesque - and embracing that part of yourself. (Notice how common it is for people to feel that they \"have\" to ostracize a part of themselves in order to avoid being ostracized by others in turn.)\n    * Most attempts at such confrontation go badly because of inadequate preparation, guidance, encouragement. There's a good reason why you locked up a part of yourself away!\n    * The inward journey towards confronting that \"monster\" requires reliving your worst experiences. This is painful and scary and you have to set aside time and space to do it. You can choose not to do it (most people put it off), but if so, then the confrontation will likely happen someday when most inconvenient, in ways that create a worse mess. I wish that wasn't true lol but it often is\n    * Beating yourself up about any of this sustains the status quo. You have to give yourself space to make mistakes and learn from them. Some artists and musicians are absolute masters at this and everyone should listen to them more (Victor Wooten and Kenny Werner are my fav got\n\u2193\n1668994712806490112 [2023-06-14] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 591 \ud83d\udd01 81\nsince I did one, I might as well do the other, so here's my latest overview of @FANswitchboard \u2013 this one clocking in at 750 words, which is basically a blogpost lol https://t.co/uOV42Psu9k\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a long text passage discussing the concept of being a \"Friendly Ambitious Nerd.\" The passage is divided into six bullet points, each exploring a different aspect of this idea.\n    \n    The text is presented on a plain white background with black font and reads:\n    \n    \"VISA, EXPLAIN FRIENDLY AMBITIOUS NERD RIGHT FUCKING NOW, IN ONE BREATH, STANDING ON ONE FOOT.\n    \n    * Throughout history there have been \u201cexceptional\u201d people who seemed to have the near-mystical ability to \u201cwalk through the walls\u201d of culture. They somehow were able to \u201cjust do stuff\u201d that nobody else around them seemed able to. This is often mythologized, pedestalized as esoteric superhuman genius, which in my view is a way for \u201cregular\u201d people to abdicate their own creativity, their own power, which they don\u2019t want to actualize because they don\u2019t want to be responsible for it.\n    * A common feature I\u2019ve noticed in a lot of these exceptional people is that, on top of being well-read, they were willing and able to articulate themselves, their desires, their goals. These goals tend to be emergent from them within themselves\u2013 a felt sense that there\u2019s some possibility hiding in plain sight that everyone else around them is missing- but also, 1. they tend to go on to corroborate and verify the possibility of these goals being manifest (NERD), and 2. they cultivate the courage necessary to commit themselves to those goals (AMBITION) and follow through for decades. And 3, they cultivate the relationships with other people that they need in order to have a supportive social environment (FRIEND).\n    * I just think it\u2019s so fucking crazy that there have been thousands of uncommonly successful people throughout history and we have so much information about how they did what they did, and yet we hardly seem to devote much in terms of time and resources to reverse-engineering them so that we can birth more \u201cexceptional\u201d \u201cgeniuses\u201d into the world and have them solve our biggest problems for us. But I\u2019ve come to understand why that is. It\u2019s because being \u201cexceptional\u201d is scary. Greatness is by definition deviance, and deviance makes people uncomfortable. Most people don\u2019t actually want their children to be smarter than them. They might say they want it, until the smart child starts making smart observations about their parents. The good news is we don\u2019t need to care about \u201cmost people\u201d in order\n\u2193\n1668995273845030912 [2023-06-14] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 90 \ud83d\udd01 4\nboth of these were inspired by a conversation with @__drewface, where he asked me \"Visa, can you challenge me right now?\" and I ended up pointing out that some of his stuff could be more accessible.

It highlights an objection to approval voting, which is that it does not capture the order of each voter's preferences like rank-choice voting does. However, the text argues that this apparent flaw is actually a strength because it solves the \"tyranny of the majority\" problem by allowing voters to add information about which tradeoffs they are willing to make.\n    \n    The text also draws a comparison to the Monty Hall problem, where relevant information is added via implicit omission rather than explicit inclusion. The background of the image is white, and the text is presented in black font.\n    \n    **Text Transcription:**\n    \n    **Making Wise Tradeoffs**\n    \n    The word \"decide\" has etymological roots that mean something like \"to cut off\" or \"to kill the alternative.\" By their nature, decisions inherently involve tradeoffs. You can't have your cake and eat it too. By choosing one option, you lose the other.\n    \n    By necessity, **making wise decisions means making wise tradeoffs.**\n    \n    One common objection to approval voting is that it does not capture the order of each voter's preferences the same way that a method like rank-choice voting does. With approval voting, a voter's first choice receives the same weight as their second choice, which initially feels wrong.\n    \n    At first glance, this seems like a flaw of approval voting. But if you look closer, you will see that it is actually approval voting's greatest strength because it solves the \"tyranny of the majority\" problem. How can this be? The answer follows from the necessity of tradeoffs.\n    \n    The counterintuitive insight is this: **by omitting information about the weightings of their preferences, voters are actually adding information about which tradeoffs they are willing to make.**\n    \n    The counterintuitiveness of this fact is similar to that of the **Monty Hall problem**. In both cases, relevant information is added via implicit omission rather than explicit inclusion.\n\u2193\n1699204164402966910 [2023-09-05] @lemonaut1 \ud83d\udc9c 1\n@danallison This is great yet I dont understand how omitting weightings of preferences results in a higher fidelity encoding of your preferences\n\u2193\n1699208319276351826 [2023-09-05] @danallison \ud83d\udc9c 2\n@lemonaut1 It can be easier to think of it as negation. Instead of maximizing satisfaction, approval voting minimizes dissatisfaction. You\u2019re (potentially) less likely to get your first choice but more likely to get a choice you\u2019re satisfied with. Images from the same blog post: https://t.co/gZpMvAXhWy\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a text passage that discusses the concept of approval voting and its application to a hypothetical scenario. The passage is divided into several paragraphs, each addressing a different aspect of the topic.\n    \n    *   The first paragraph introduces the scenario, describing a group of three people deciding where to eat for lunch. Two members are carnivores who always eat meat, and one is a vegan who never eats meat.\n        *   The three restaurants being considered are:\n            1.  A BBQ place with no vegan options (the carnivores' first choice)\n            2.  A vegan diner with no meat options (the vegan's first choice)\n            3.  A sandwich shop with both meat and vegan options (everyone's second choice)\n    *   The second paragraph explains that the common sense decision would be to go to the restaurant that has options for everyone: the sandwich shop. This is because approval voting converges on this outcome.\n    *   The third paragraph notes that most other voting methods, including rank-choice voting, surprisingly converge on the BBQ place because the carnivores are a majority, creating a rivalrous dynamic between these sub-groups. This failure mode is often referred to as the \"tyranny of the majority.\"\n    *   The fourth paragraph states that approval voting avoids this pitfall by optimizing for overall group satisfaction rather than majority rule.\n    \n    In summary, the image presents a clear and concise explanation of how approval voting can lead to a more satisfactory outcome for a group, as opposed to other voting methods that may result in the \"tyranny of the majority.\"\n\u2193\n1699211783687623064 [2023-09-06] @danallison \ud83d\udc9c 2\n@lemonaut1 An analogy might be luggage on an airplane.

The passage is divided into two main points, numbered 1 and 2, which are presented in black text on a white background.\n    \n    1 - There's a shared interest in having people live in hyperreality. This is what your 10k hours at school made you an expert in. This is why people, generally, can't think nor do things: their concepts don't dereference: they're all signifiers pointing to further signifiers. This is also why people's skills EXPLODE once they unlearn how to not see. This is also also why you get gas stove discourse, palestine flag emojis, etc.: floating signifiers make it so that anything can be shoved inside them and thus allow both capital AND political identity to circulate FAST.\n    \n    2 - People have a folk theory of language. This theory is mistaken in many ways and these mistakes get arbitraged/weaponised against them.\n    \n    The passage appears to be a screenshot of a social media post or a note, given its informal tone and the presence of a tweet context at the top.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 1750451128808907072 [2024-01-25] @nosilverv \ud83d\udc9c 21\n\u2502   I bet you guys are shocked by my brevity, lol!\n\u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   1751885080790761552 [2024-01-29] @nosilverv \ud83d\udc9c 14\n\u2502   Another way of saying 2:\n\u2502   \n\u2502   \"Mistakes are generative not just subtractive (pieta bc of Greek statues lost color)\n\u2502   Mistaking language for camera is omnipresent\n\u2502   This mistake allows it to be used like engine\"\n\u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   1752074308564762878 [2024-01-29] @nosilverv \ud83d\udc9c 6\n\u2502   read this and above. this is why in the glossary i talk about rectification of names\n\u2502   \n\u2502   https://t.co/nDaoz2YLqM\n\u2502     [Quoting Tweet 1752073724411445615 (missing)]\n\u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   1752274300730503426 [2024-01-30] @nosilverv \ud83d\udc9c 5\n\u2502   Another way of saying 3: \n\u2502   \n\u2502   https://t.co/TTLutCsG0s\n\u2502     [Quoting @nosilverv: All my project is naming and calling out dark magicians bs, trying to make it opaque instead of transparent https://t.co/dZG1kHXZTV https://t.co/7Pn7TuKXYV]\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 1750452419782422753 [2024-01-25] @JustAnkurBagchi \ud83d\udc9c 3\n\u2502   @nosilverv What is the folk theory of language?\n\u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   1750454466178920606 [2024-01-25] @nosilverv \ud83d\udc9c 24 \ud83d\udcac 1\n\u2502   It's a theory of what language is and how it works.

The symbolic order is a network of language and social conventions that governs how we perceive and interact with the world. In this context, hyperreality refers to an inability to distinguish between reality and a simulation of reality, often perpetuated by media and technology. The tweet suggests that education (10k hours at school) immerses individuals deeply into this symbolic order, to the point where they struggle to engage with the 'real' outside of these constructs.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       2.

The title, displayed prominently at the top, is followed by a brief introduction that sets the stage for the discussion.\n    \n    The main content is organized into seven bullet points, each with sub-bullets that provide further elaboration. The first point defines \"full meta-trust\" and its significance in facilitating open communication and collaboration. The subsequent points delve into the challenges of establishing trust, the importance of respecting others' distrust, and the need to manage one's own distrust.\n    \n    The outline also explores the concept of \"trust-dancing\" and its role in building trust within a group. It highlights the difficulties of adding new members to a group while maintaining the existing trust dynamics. Additionally, the outline touches on the idea of \"increasing trust within a group\" and the need for humility and creativity in the process.\n    \n    Throughout the outline, quotes from notable figures such as Prentis Hemphill and M. Aurelius are incorporated to add depth and context to the discussion. The text is presented in a clean and readable format, with a white background that provides a neutral backdrop for the content.\n    \n    Overall, the image effectively conveys complex ideas related to bootstrapping meta-trust in a concise and organized manner, making it an informative and engaging visual aid.\n\u2193\n1820578389780312240 [2024-08-05] @Malcolm_Ocean \ud83d\udc9c 5\nthis was written during a tiny Writing It Live! sprint with @HunterGlenn\u2014he picked it out of 6 potential topics I offered!\n\nto learn more and book a time with me to do something similar (could be 1-3h instead of 30mins), go here:\nhttps://t.co/7WvKUKPy2b\n  [Quoting @Malcolm_Ocean: WRITING IT LIVE challenge Let's write for each other and publish it.

The boundary object is the *constraint itself*\u2014forcing brevity/vulnerability creates a permission structure for self-revelation. Unlike static social rituals, this evolves: early versions focus on overcoming participation friction, later versions (2023-2024) explicitly frame as 'scenius-building' and generate durable artifacts (one-pagers become a mini-genre). The strand is dialectical in structure\u2014each iteration tests different constraints (time, format, audience) and the community refines what works.
