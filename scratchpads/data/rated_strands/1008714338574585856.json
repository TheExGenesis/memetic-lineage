It isn't economic precarity, we're very rich. It isn't lack of social community, we actually choose that. It isnt a lack of spirituality or an abundance of plastics or this or that. It's just information abundance.  Imagine the ancestral village. How often do you get new information about the world? What works, what threats there are, what food is abundant, what others think of you... you do get that from time to time, more if you're out ranging for food. And what it all has in common is its all life or death. Starvation is a risk if you mismanage food or predators, injury risks infection and death. The opinion of the humans around you is especially dangerous - who gets fed in lean times? And of course tall poppy syndrome predominates hunter gatherers so if you're too useful you may meet an unfortunate riverbed fall too.   Your mind evolved in an environment where most new information was life and death especially the opinions of others.  You live in an environment where you are constantly awash in new information and the opinions of others.  How would a mind grown in the former respond to the latter? It would be constantly on edge, frantically searching to see the hidden meaning behind every social cue, the threat in every circumstance, the risks to every good thing. There would be so many things to worry about it could never hit them all.  And so it would respond like a mind in the village having an endless web of panics would respond - it would assume on some subconscious level that the environment was dangerous and pull away. Pull away from social situations it cant manage, pull away from resource sources it can't maintain. Retreat, retrench, recoil. Anyone who's ever struggled with anxiety can imagine easily. And indeed what do we see, as technology becomes more prevalent, the information diet gets more constant? More people retreat, retrench, recoil from everything. Even video games obviously fit this - village brain wants to find a different environment that's going better than it thinks yours is. And it gets it. Challenging but bounded, very satisfying to thrive in.  And of course people are different, the rising tide hits different people sooner. The young more not just because they're more digital and less fully formed mentally but because they have less context, less anchored sense of what really matters. But some are more stress tolerant than others, have better ability to identify what matters and phase out other signals than others. But neurotic agreeable people (nervous people who really care about what others think) are in trouble.  And that's it basically. The other stuff is more satisfying and a better story but frankly i think it's just that simple.]\n\n===\n\n1019925117508472837 [2018-07-19] @ultimape \ud83d\udc9c 37 \ud83d\udd01 4\nI don't seem to have the GLUT1 deficiency, but I researched all of this too.

('You're very clever, young man, but it's reductionism all the way down!') This is in some sense the opposite of a mathematician: a mathematician tries to 'see through' a complex system's accidental complexity up to a simpler more-abstract more-true version which can be understood & manipulated\u2014but for the hacker, all complexity is essential, and they are instead trying to unsee the simple abstract system down to the more-complex less-abstract (but also more true) version. (A mathematician might try to transform a program up into successively more abstract representations to eventually show it is trivially correct; a hacker would prefer to compile a program down into its most concrete representation to brute force all execution paths & find an exploit trivially proving it incorrect.) Ordinary users ask only that all their everyday examples of Ys transforms into Z correctly; they forget to ask whether all and only correct examples of Ys transform into correct Zs, and whether only correct Zs can be constructed to become Ys.\"\n\u2193\n1252830348909539329 [2020-04-22] @ultimape \ud83d\udc9c 2\nAngels and Devils all came from the divine creator.

The text is transcribed as follows:\n    \n    The AEGL-2 was based on an exposure of cynomolgus monkeys to a concentration of HCN at 60 ppm for 30 min, which resulted in a slight increase in the respiratory minute volume near the end of the exposure and a slight depressive effect on the central nervous system as evidenced by changes in electroencephalograms, also near the end of the exposure; there was no physiological response (Purser 1984). The mechanism of action of HCN is the same for all mammalian species, but the rapidity and intensity of the toxic effect is related to relative respiration rates as well as pharmacokinetic considerations. Based on relative respiration rates, the uptake of HCN by the monkey is more rapid than that of humans. The monkey is an appropriate model for extrapolation to humans because, compared with rodents, the respiratory systems of monkeys and humans are more similar in gross anatomy, the amount and distribution of types of respiratory epithelium, and airflow pattern. Because the monkey is an appropriate model for humans but is potentially more susceptible to the action of cyanide based on relative respiration rates, an interspecies UF of 2 was applied. Humans may differ in their sensitivity to HCN, but no data regarding specific differences among humans were located in the available literature. The detoxifying enzyme rhodanese is present in all individuals, including newborns. Therefore, an intraspecies UF of 3 was applied. The 30-min concentration of 60 ppm from the Purser (1984) study was divided by a combined interspecies and intraspecies UF of 6 and scaled across time for the AEGL-specified exposure periods using the relationship C^2\u00d7t=k. The safety of the 30-min and 1-h values of 10 and 7.1 ppm, respectively, is supported by monitoring studies in which chronic exposures to average concentrations of 8 to 10 ppm may have produced primarily reversible central nervous system effects such as headaches in some workers (El Ghawabi et al. 1975).\n\u2193\n1434456921201942530 [2021-09-05] @ultimape \ud83d\udc9c 4\nI'm... going to stop here.

Yay!]\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image shows a scientific text discussing radon decay products and their behavior in the air. The text is transcribed as follows:\n    \n    \"After decay in air, the nuclides react in less than one second with trace gases and air vapor, forming clusters of 0.5\u20135 nm size, also called the \"unattached progeny\", which are positively charged and highly mobile [23,24]. Within 100 s, those clusters may attach to aerosol particles by diffusion, described by gas kinetic laws. The parameter that mostly influences the fraction of attached daughter nuclides is the number of aerosols [25] with the influence of electrostatic forces considered to be negligible [23,26]. The formed particles build the \"attached progeny\" for which diffusion coefficient measurements showed three distinct size ranges. These are called nucleation mode covering sizes from 10\u2013100 nm, accumulation mode with particle sizes ranging from 100\u2013450 nm and the coarse mode for particles larger than 1 \u03bcm [1]. The size distribution is strongly influenced by the aerosol mixture in the air. Accordingly, all studies show slightly different results but were consistent in the fact that the highest activity originates from radon decay products bound to aerosols associated with the accumulation mode [1,25,27]. Moreover, measurements showed that over 90% of the activity is associated with the \"attached progeny\" while the \"unattached progeny\" accounts for only 10% [21,23], being, in turn, three to five times more effective in dose commitment due to its smaller size [28].\n    \n    Once built, solid daughter nuclei deposit on surfaces such as walls and furniture by different mechanisms (sedimentation, impaction, interception and diffusion), resulting in a lower activity concentration of the decay products in indoor-air than expected from equilibrium with radon [23,27]. This and other removal processes reduce the concentration of radon decay products, depending on a number of interlinked parameters such as the loss by radioactive decay, ventilation or the aforementioned deposition on room surfaces [29].\"\n\u2193\n1513717360422752257 [2022-04-12] @ultimape \nI have no idea what I'm doing.
