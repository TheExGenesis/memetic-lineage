And not sacred as in solemn, but sacred as in profound. &amp; even fart jokes can have a profundity to them if you get it right. But strangely few comedians seem to get it.

The quotes are connected by black arrows, indicating relationships between the different ideas.\n    \n    Some of the quotes include \"Prioritize. There's an infinite set of things to do. What's the most important thing? Do that,\" \"Make Friends. It is dangerous to go alone. You heal yourself by helping others. Be kind and serve others.

See below for my write-up of the problem. https://t.co/47DZNEJFkf\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a screenshot of a text post discussing the author's experience with \"GCR trauma,\" which refers to the emotional distress caused by contemplating global catastrophic risks (GCRs). The text is written in a conversational tone and is divided into eight paragraphs.\n    \n    Here is a transcription of the text:\n    \n    \"I could use some help with what I'm labeling as 'GCR trauma.'\n    \n    There's still a strong part of me that's trying to **instrumentalize everything** I do toward preventing global catastrophic risks (GCRs). Or more like: instrumentalist everything toward putting me back in shape to help prevent GCRs in the future. (I'm still dealing with the remnants of a gut condition that was disabling.)\n    \n    The part is not afraid of death, it's afraid of intense pain, which is why it's more concerned about GCRs than XRisks. It's afraid of direct pain, eg, living in a post-catastrophe world and dealing with starvation and violence. It's also afraid of indirect empathetic pain, eg, finding out that my parents or friends got messed up by a war or the next pandemic.\n    \n    The **instrumentalize-everything** part seems to be crowding out other values - eg fulfilling relationships, making art, having a slow day, etc. It does this via the belief that - if I spend time on the other ends-in-themselves - then I'll forfeit my chance to make some kind of difference.\n    \n    The way I found this part just now was by suddenly noticing I lost motivation to do anything upon becoming pessimistic about my being able to make a difference to GCR outcomes. =(\n    \n    I think the best way to interact with it is to take the concern seriously, since I do think it's tracking reality. (ie the reality that surprised us with a global pandemic.) I also want to take seriously the idea that I could make a difference, given that I've been quite capable in the past.\n    \n    One solution is to help the part understand that I probably will burn out or not make a serious difference if I fail to live in an inspired state, which I can only get by engaging my other values. But I'm a little worried that this will cause instrumentality to leak into all my other values-engaging activities in an unhealthy way.\n    \n    I imagine lots of EAs have this problem.

It's reported that Roger's adult gay sketches started as a hobby in the 1970's when he was a teenager. His fantasies were sparked by the men he would see living and working all around him, and he was able to translate \"everyday guys\" into visions of what might happen in private, given the right opportunities. He studied at London's St. Martin's School of Modern Art. For a while, Roger made a living by making historic illustrations for children's books. Later, he was invited to work for publications like Advocate Men and Handjobs. When the Internet came into millions of homes, his works exploded everywhere. There have been at least three collections of his art, including 2007's ROGER which have become treasured by his admirers.\"\n        \n        The photograph on the right shows a man wearing a green cap and a blue jacket, with the name \"Roger Payne\" written in white cursive text at the bottom.\n    \u2193\n    1475243746019082244 [2021-12-26] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 26 \ud83d\udd01 2\n    you can see the horny energy even in the work that he did for historical publications like Look and Learn magazine, lol https://t.co/IcJPsAKy61\n    Images:\n      - [Image #0] The image depicts a serene illustration of three men in ancient Greek attire seated on a hillside, overlooking a picturesque town.

The graph shows that when the challenge is too high and the skill is too low, it leads to frustration or anxiety. Conversely, when the skill is high and the challenge is low, it results in boredom. The optimal state is achieved when the challenge and skill are balanced, leading to a state of flow.\n\u2193\n1653321409383530497 [2023-05-02] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 60 \ud83d\udd01 1 [(SEED) type=quote_of_root]\nits ayy all over again, every time... lmao\n\nhttps://t.co/cLpQFc4h1N\n  [Quoting @visakanv: this is the heart of philosophy, all else is commentary \ud83e\uddd0 https://t.co/7uu4B9YhpH]\n\u2193\n1653322074088427520 [2023-05-02] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 34\nhere's a more grounded way of talking about all of this\n\nso like, from the time i was a kid i've had all this frustration, anxiety, shame about not being able to keep up with my responsibilities\n\nover my 20s i actually became successful at managing those responsibilities! yay!\n\u2193\n1653322149640433665 [2023-05-02] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 39\nbut like, the reward of success is the prospect of more responsibility, lol https://t.co/F69HnnTfCW\n  [Quoting @visakanv: i am behind on my DMs and emails. apologies. i originally came to the internet to get away from my responsibilities and somehow it has birthed new responsibilities]\n\u2193\n1653322794091032576 [2023-05-02] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 24\nthat's a murky claim, through a murky lens. it more accurately describes me and my insecurities/anxieties than it describes reality. there are definitely many ways of framing and addressing this problem. \n\nbut 'til I find a better frame, my threshold guardian will keep me trapped\n\u2193\n1653324860817547264 [2023-05-02] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 46 \ud83d\udd01 6\npart of me doesn't want to fail\npart of me doesn't want to succeed\nall the possible paths are painful to walk\nstaying still also hurts\n\nvery classic omni-tangle \n\nnote to self that even if everything seems to suck, it's still worth taking the path of least suck\n\u2193\n1653334781860663299 [2023-05-02] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 45 \ud83d\udd01 5 \ud83d\udcac 1\nprobably worth taking an hour to write down what all the paths seem to be, because chances are \"all the paths seem painful\" is a bit of an illusion. it's improbable that all the paths are rocky, it's likelier that you have a rock in your shoe\n\u2193\n1653705931517992961 [2023-05-03] @aleksil79 \ud83d\udc9c 2\n@visakanv my family is my pet rock. no, I won't be taking it out of my shoe.\n\n===\n\n1655215763953963008 [2023-05-07] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 90 \ud83d\udd01 7\nsomeone asked what I mean by A+ talent\n\nI personally define it as the ability to step into a situation, figure out what's going on, identify what needs doing, figure out how to do it, and do it\n\nhere's an example from a specific domain: https://t.co/tv5evt0FLf\n  [Quoting @visakanv: \"mani is so slow, so unfit, his ball handling is so mediocre, his shots are so average. the only thing he has going for him is that he mysteriously somehow always manages to be at the right place at the right time to score goals\"]\n\u2193\n1655216394760491012 [2023-05-07] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 23\nI'm mediocre at football, but I'm an A+ talent when it comes to \"playing twitter\".

    "reasoning_summary": "This strand represents a multi-year evolution of a philosophical framework for navigating paradoxes and tensions. The boundary object is the 'ayy lmao' meme format (Odysseus sailing between Scylla and Charybdis), which Visakanv created in September 2021. The arc shows: (1) Pre-history: years of exploring comedy as sacred, meaning/meaninglessness tensions, and the need for humor in facing absurdity (2019-2021), (2) Catalyst: the viral meme crystallizing these ideas into a remixable format (Sept 2021), (3) Dialectic: hundreds of people adopting and remixing the framework to map their own tensions, (4) Realization: the meme becoming a cultural shorthand for dynamic balance, referenced across diverse contexts from relationships to epistemology to parenting. This is primarily constructive - people use it as a practical tool for navigating real dilemmas rather than arguing about which pole is correct. The framework has demonstrated remarkable staying power (3+ years) and generativity (spawning countless variations).",
