The discourse is primarily **constructive**\u2014people riff on and extend the core insight rather than attacking it. The idea demonstrates high **memetic fitness** (repeatedly quoted/remixed) and moderate **conceptual evolution** (from sex \u2192 fuckability-as-capital \u2192 status anxiety \u2192 mimetic desire). However, it remains largely a **diagnostic tool** rather than producing actionable solutions or institutional change.",
