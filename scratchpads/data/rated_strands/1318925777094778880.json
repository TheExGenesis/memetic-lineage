It explains that people often try to prevent unwanted behaviors by addressing the root of the problem, which is the energy itself, rather than the symptom.\n    \n    The article is divided into four paragraphs, each discussing a different aspect of internal energies. The text is written in a formal tone and includes technical terms such as \"tantric point of view\" and \"high-energy internal stalemates.\" \n    \n    The article's content is as follows:\n    \n    \"Internal energies, such as emotions, have no inherent meaning.\n    Biologically, though, they evolved to prompt particular patterns of action. \n    Anger primes you for violence, for example. Often these evolved responses are unhelpful in our current environments, and so we (rightly) seek to prevent them. To do that, we often go to what seems the root of the problem \u2014 the energies themselves \u2014 rather than the unwanted behaviors, which are only a symptom.\n    \n    Unfortunately, it is not possible to turn off\u2014or even turn down\u2014individual energies. It would be handy if we had a row of volume knobs and could adjust anger and lust up or down as needed. But our bodies don't work that way. (From the tantric point of view, this is fortunate in the long run.)\n    \n    So one strategy is to oppose a problem energy with another. For example, to stop yourself from strangling your pointy-haired boss, you might focus on your intense desire for a promotion. That cuts off the channel through which the anger might flow.\n    \n    These deliberate blockages can lead to high-energy internal stalemates. Those are felt as frustration, internal division, and emotional turbulence. Generally they eventually erupt, when the opposing energies fail to balance.\"\n\u2193\n1205995673641865221 [2019-12-14] @QiaochuYuan \ud83d\udc9c 53 \ud83d\udd01 5\n@Meaningness 8. it is possible to let go of the stance that emotions have any fixed meaning. feeling fear doesn't have to mean you're weak; feeling sadness doesn't have to mean you're a crybaby; feeling anger doesn't have to mean you're bad or evil\n\nmuch easier to allow emotion this way\n\u2193\n1205996221501849600 [2019-12-14] @QiaochuYuan \ud83d\udc9c 33 \ud83d\udd01 1\n@Meaningness 9. you don't have to do emotional regulation alone, although sometimes you may have no other choice. we naturally regulate each other. being around a calm person who's attuned to you is calming. you can learn to be this sort of person for others as well\n\u2193\n1205996768841748481 [2019-12-14] @QiaochuYuan \ud83d\udc9c 32 \ud83d\udd01 1\n@Meaningness 10. and, skillfully helping others with their emotions is hard and most people don't know how to do it!

The first section defines the XY problem as a situation where someone asks for help with their attempted solution (Y) rather than their actual problem (X). It lists several bullet points that illustrate how this problem arises, including:\n    \n    * The user wants to do X but doesn't know how.\n    * The user thinks they can solve X if they can just manage to do Y.\n    * Others try to help with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem.\n    * After much interaction and wasted time, it becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn't even a suitable solution for X.\n    \n    The second section provides guidance on how to address the XY problem. It suggests that users should:\n    \n    1. Always include information about the broader picture along with any attempted solution.\n    2. If someone asks for more information, provide details.\n    3.

I publicly did something I\u2019m embarrassed about and I want to apologize and do my best to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nI got really angry about a recent trend online and posted saying that if you believed this thing I considered dumb and unethical, I didn\u2019t want to be friends with you anymore.\n\nI then proceeded to block people who were disagreeing with me in the comments.\n\nThis sort of behavior is the opposite of what I stand for and I think contributes to so much unnecessary suffering.\n\nThe moment I realized what I had done, I removed the post, to stop a continuation of the social media outrage cycle. I spent the rest of the day trying to understand the problem so I could better never do it again. I wrote up some of how to do that in a recent post (link in comments)\n\nI DMd and unblocked the people I feel like I was particularly rude to, and apologized, and I\u2019m also publicly apologizing in general, because I want to be the change I wish to see in the world.\n\nI don\u2019t want to live in a world where people stop being friends because we disagree.\n\nI think a lot of opinions are dumb and unethical.\n\nI'm sure I have a lot of beliefs that others consider dumb and unethical\n\nThe way to improve isn\u2019t to get mad at people then threaten to withdraw your friendship.\n\nIt\u2019s to try to come to mutual understanding and respect and discuss ideas civilly. It\u2019s to persuade, not freak out. It\u2019s to use ethical reasoning. It\u2019s to defend ideas calmly and assume good intentions unless you have strong evidence to the contrary.\n\nI've also had my mind changed more times than I can count, discovering that things I thought were dumb and unethical were not in fact so. And I wouldn't have discovered that if I only talked to people who thought as I did.\n\nI'm sorry. I feel ashamed, because I broke my own moral code and caused unnecessary suffering to people I care about. And it's made all the worse because I have no mitigating circumstances. I just felt angry. It was my fault.\n\nI hope that my realizing what I'd done and quickly removing the ongoing source of hurt and then problem solving to make sure it won't happen again are enough to have people forgive me and trust that I've taken steps to fix things.\n\nI'm sure I'll mess up again, but hopefully in new and different ways, and I'll have friends who will be able to gently point it out, and I can grow and learn from it.\n\nSorry, guys.

The text is in black font and appears to be a continuation of a story about a person named Jamie who is experiencing anxiety.\n    \n    The passage is divided into six paragraphs, each describing Jamie's thoughts and feelings as he tries to manage his anxiety. The text is written in a narrative style, with the author using descriptive language to convey Jamie's emotions and physical sensations.\n    \n    To reproduce the image, one would need to create a digital document or graphic with a beige background and black text, using a font that matches the one used in the original image. The text would need to be arranged in the same six-paragraph structure, with the same content and formatting as the original.\n    \n    Here is the text from the image:\n    \n    \"Jamie stared at the clock: ten minutes until his turn to present. His stomach knotted and his hands trembled slightly as he sat in the back of the classroom.\n    \n    There it is again, he thought, recognising the familiar feeling of anxiety. Instead of trying to ignore it or wish it away, he decided to try something different this time.\n    \n    First, he just noticed what was happening in his body. My heart's beating really fast. My shoulders are tight. My breathing is shallow. He didn't try to change these sensations-just observed them with curiosity, like a scientist studying something interesting.\n    \n    \"It's okay that you're here,\" he silently told the anxiety. Usually, he'd get frustrated with himself for feeling this way, but today he was trying to be a friend to his feelings rather than fighting them.\n    \n    As his mind raced with thoughts like \"I'm going to mess up\" and \"Everyone will laugh,\" Jamie didn't push these thoughts away. Instead, he noticed them passing through his mind like clouds in the sky. There's a worried thought. There's another one. Just thoughts, not facts.\n    \n    He placed one hand on his chest, feeling his heartbeat. My toes aren't anxious, he realized. My knees aren't anxious either. The anxiety wasn't everywhere-just in certain places.\n    \n    Jamie took a slow breath, not to make the anxiety\"\n    \n    This text describes Jamie's experience of anxiety and his attempts to manage it by observing his physical sensations and thoughts, and practicing self-compassion.\n\u2193\n1909163976535003618 [2025-04-07] @_brentbaum \n@heynibras woh there's something very very good here.

I posted at the top [1], declaring that I no longer suffered. It\u2019s been over a year since then, and that original statement wasn\u2019t 100% accurate. More like 97%.\n\nSince last June, there\u2019s been a handful of emotional and a couple physical experiences that have caused me to suffer. A ten hour tattoo session, McDonalds binge that triggered stomach pain and returning cancer fear, indoor olympics performance issue caused much shame and disappointment, intense waves of prolonged fear caused by airplane turbulence [2], and a few other periods I\u2019m sure happened but I didn\u2019t log. So about ten or less days where I suffered. 355/365 days, or 97% of the rest of the year I didn\u2019t suffer.\n\nI mean suffering with a capital S. What remained after that shift in June didn\u2019t feel like I was Suffering. What remained included occasional slight, subtler meh-ness here and there, slight unsatisfactoriness. Calling those \u201csuffering\u201d feels inaccurate, like it trivializes the level of suck I felt when experiencing the components I bundled up in what I called \u201cnegative\u201d emotions in the past. And those subtler ouchies that prevent 100 proof peace have dissolved more and more in the momentum gained from that before-after event last June.\n\nWhy have some moments still caused suffering? Maybe there\u2019s experiences that are rare and trigger dusty conditioning which hasn\u2019t been rewritten yet, where the logic behind resistance to emotional experience still lingers. Some patterns of my experience support that idea.\n\nOr perhaps certain levels of combined duration and intensity of \u201cnegative\u201d emotions still cause suffering, that the June shift just raised the capacity much higher but not all the way to account for the full range of what god\u2019s gonna gift me. Some patterns of my experience support that idea, but maybe it\u2019s also a characteristic of the former, where high levels of both duration and intensity of \u201cnegative\u201d emotion trigger not-updated code.\n\nI didn\u2019t need off-retreat deterministic access to higher jhanas or multiple cessations or 35 noticings per second to stop resisting emotions, just a sporadic practice of looking in direct experience in specific ways (for like four months). But deterministic access to the second jhana, and the emotional work needed to get high without drugs, certainly helped weaken resistance to emotions.\n\nIt\u2019s exciting that the jhanas are more widely known, even if still much an open secret outside meditation/tech twitter. And that it\u2019s possible to nix the default assumptions causing emotional resistance using seemingly simple inquiry practices, or most suffering, is an even bigger open secret.\n\nThere\u2019s a handful of other folks who publicly share that they've reproduced the results I\u2019m talking about using the same practices, and I hope lots more do so. The shift last June has been the biggest upgrade to my wellbeing, but I\u2019m not a special person who did something exceedingly hard. You can drop emotional resistance too, and there can be lots of ease and enjoyment along the way.\n\nIt took me a long time to experience my first jhana, and now most people learn in a week via Jhourney [3]. I hope a similar quickening happens with these inquiry practices.\n\nI don\u2019t know if how I feel is permanent, but over a year is great, and I don\u2019t know why it\u2019d stop being this way anytime soon. I\u2019d love to help others drop default resistance to emotion using jhanas and inquiry. I\u2019m doing more 1:1 calls with folks when I\u2019m not working Jhourney retreats.

Correct?\n\u2193\n1956691334892560736 [2025-08-16] @blissbrah \nso i was doing inquiry for like 4 months until the shift happened, but I'd also been meditating awhile before that and alongside doing the inquiry up until the shift. \n\naccording to going theory, you also have to drop another prior before reactivity. i have blog posts on f1-5 which talk about the techniques and provide more resources\n\n===\n",

    "reasoning_summary": "This strand traces a multi-year evolution in understanding emotional self-regulation and 'non-coercion,' anchored by Qiaochu's 2019 conceptual foundation and crystallized through Rival's 2020 'gym crying' case study with Yatharth. The boundary object is the tension between 'doing what you should' vs. 'allowing what you feel'\u2014a dialectical exploration that moves from abstract parts-work theory to concrete coaching demonstrations to longitudinal testimonials of transformation. The arc shows high evolution: from identifying the problem (inner critic warfare, coercion-as-default) to developing vocabulary ('attunement,' 'blending,' 'surrogate selfing') to practitioners reporting sustained shifts in baseline emotional reactivity. Utility is exceptionally high for the rationalist/post-rat community struggling with productivity-shame spirals, offering both theoretical maps and replicable techniques.",
