The brain doesn't appreciate constant focus, and life is a drag if all you do is work. Resting, daydreaming, fooling around, laughing, napping, and playing are extremely important in a whole and happy life. Learning to flow means learning to relax; it's important to keep things light. However, if you can't ground, focus, or define yourself when you want to, that's a horse of a different color.\n\u2502           \n\u2502           It is easy to get into troubling moods or stagnant places and forget all your skills and all your emotional wisdom; it's easy to fall into emotional repression and incompetent expression. When this happens (and it will), your ignored and mismanaged emotions will intensify and repeat themselves\u2014because neither repression nor improper expression can ever address the issues your emotions are trying to bring forward. If you continue to ignore your emotions (and you will), they'll become louder and more aggressive. Soon, they'll arise in response to totally unrelated situations. Cycling depressions and rages, anxiety attacks, and obsessive worry are all examples of emotions that have become trapped in a bothersome feedback loop. What started out as mobile emotions become monotonous, tormenting, and chronic responses to the world.\n\u2502           \n\u2502           When your emotions are welcomed and honored, they move easily and quickly\u2014they arise in response to real situations, they contribute precisely what you need, and then they retreat cheerfully. In contrast, a disruption\n\u2502       \u2193\n\u2502       1425953167657906181 [2021-08-12] @relic_radiation \ud83d\udc9c 1\n\u2502       @visakanv Go for it, make a complaining shrine with dark or annoying colors.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       &amp; now after reading your tweet, I\u2019ll end the sessions with jokes about \u201chaha what if &lt;inverse of complaint&gt; HAHAHA\u201d\n\u2502       \n\u2502       \ud83c\udf89 https://t.co/TQmX1cb7rt\n\u2502       Images:\n\u2502         - [Image #0] The image is a photo of a book with a section of black text on a white page.

The passage is written in white text and discusses how researchers from the University of Manchester used a wind tunnel to test the effects of hypersonic heat transfer on a steak, with the results showing that the surface was charred while the interior remained raw.\n    \n    The text is divided into five paragraphs, each describing a different aspect of the experiment. The first paragraph introduces the researchers and their experiment, while the second and third paragraphs describe the two videos taken during the experiment, one using Schlieren imaging and the other using an infrared thermal camera. The fourth paragraph summarizes the results of the experiment, concluding that cooking a steak in a wind tunnel is not an effective method. The final paragraph thanks the researchers and promotes the author's book, \"What If? 2\", which is available for purchase.\n    \n    The text includes a link to the author's website, https://xkcd.com/what-if-2/, at the bottom.\n  - [Image #1] The image shows a screenshot of an Instagram post featuring a page from the book \"What If?\" by xkcd. The page discusses the hypothetical scenario of dropping a steak from space and its effects on the steak's temperature and composition.\n    \n    **Text from the Image:**\n    \n    *   \"into a semi-stable spheroid shape. However, this is little more than a wild guess. **If anyone puts a steak in a hypersonic wind tunnel to get better data on this, please, send me the video.** \n    *   If you drop the steak from 250 kilometers, things start to heat up; 250 kilometers puts us in the range of low Earth orbit. However, the steak, since it's dropped from a standstill, isn't moving nearly as fast as an object reentering from orbit. \n    *   In this scenario, the steak reaches a top speed of Mach 6, and the outer surface may even get pleasantly seared. The inside, unfortunately, is still uncooked. Unless, that is, it goes into a hypersonic tumble and explodes into chunks. \n    *   From higher altitudes, the heat starts to get really substantial. The shockwave in front of the steak reaches thousands of degrees (Fahrenheit or Celsius; it's true in both). The problem with this level of heat is that it burns the surface layer completely, converting it to little more than carbon. That is, it becomes charred.\"\n    *   **Diagram:**\n        *   A graph titled \"Steak Speed\" on the y-axis and \"Steak Altitude\" on the x-axis.\n        *   Two lines are plotted: \"Path Without Atmosphere\" and \"Path With Atmosphere.\"\n        *   The graph illustrates the steak's speed as it descends through the atmosphere, with the \"Path With Atmosphere\" line showing a significant increase in speed due to atmospheric friction.\n    *   **Instagram Post:**\n        *   \"xkcd In the first What If? book, I answered a question about cooking a steak by dropping it from space.

A secret brotherhood of alchemists and sages has a plan: inspire a renaissance through secret knowledge for the betterment of humanity\n\nLet's talk about the crazy story of the Confessio Fraternitatis \ud83e\uddf5\n\n===\n\n1831989667979235435 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \nSo what does Confessio have to say?\n\nCritique: contemporary (1600s) philosophy, science, and religion is corrupt; establishment churches are corrupt, and dominant academic systems are ineffective.\n\u2193\n1831990143927935278 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \nPromise of Reformation.  we need spiritual and intellectual renewal; the secret brotherhood signals now is the moment. Rosicrucians (\"The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross\") claim to have esoteric knowledge that can transform religion, society, and science\n\u2193\n1831990484731932683 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \nMystical &amp; Alchemical Wisdom: Confessio Fraternitatis says the group has access to hidden truths about nature and the cosmos, and that these truths will soon be revealed to the world.\n\u2193\n1831990767360831593 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \nSecrecy: the group intends to share their knowledge, but must remain hidden to protect the work from corruption and misuse\n\nInvitation: those who are genuinely seeking truth can join the fraternity. Only open to those who are ready\n\u2193\n1831991081715605959 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \nSelf-Defense: the fraternity are not heretics or sorcerers, arguing that their intentions are pure; presenting themselves as servants of God. This would've been important at a time of high levels of expected religious orthodoxy, to not get members killed\n\u2193\n1831991330190336460 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \ud83d\udc9c 1\nProphecy: a coming era of enlightenment and peace; Rosicrucian knowledge will transform the world. The\"Golden Age\" will be marked by the harmony of science, religion, and art.\n\u2193\n1831992123572240782 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \nthis is ... kinda crazy? How would readers have interpreted this when it came out?\n\nWell, it was the meme text because it very much reflected the spirit of the day https://t.co/52JuNmLXMK\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a slide about the religious climate in Europe during the 17th century. The title, \"1. Religious Climate:\", is prominently displayed at the top left of the image in white text against a black background.\n    \n    Below the title are three bullet points that provide information about the religious climate during this time period:\n    \n    *   **Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation**: This section explains how Europe was deeply divided by the Reformation, which began in the early 16th century with Martin Luther's challenge to the Catholic Church. By 1615, Protestant and Catholic factions were entrenched in opposition. The Protestant Reformation had led to the establishment of various Protestant denominations (Lutheran, Calvinist, Anglican, etc.), while the Catholic Church responded with the Counter-Reformation, aimed at internal reform and the suppression of Protestant movements.\n    *   **Religious Wars**: This section discusses how religious tensions often spilled over into violent conflict. The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) was about to erupt, driven largely by the clash between Protestant and Catholic states in the Holy Roman Empire. This war would devastate much of Central Europe, exacerbating religious and political divisions.\n    *   **Religious Persecution**: This section highlights how both Protestant and Catholic authorities engaged in persecution of religious minorities. Heretics, witches, and nonconformists were often prosecuted, tortured, and executed. The Inquisition, particularly in Catholic regions, sought to enforce orthodoxy and suppress dissent.\n    \n    Overall, the image provides a concise overview of the complex and often contentious religious landscape of 17th-century Europe.\n\u2193\n1831992704915402819 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \nits publishing kicked off broad speculation. Following from the first pamphlet, you got all the same reactions of skepticism &amp; enthusiasm that one got, intrigue at the key ideas, and also some growing hostility: these people are heretics and need to be killed. https://t.co/RVgIyrvDvE\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a still from the movie \"The Witches of Eastwick\" with a superimposed caption. The scene shows a crowd of people shouting, with two women in the foreground and a man behind them. The caption reads 'BURN THE WITCH!' 'BURN HER!' in white text at the bottom of the image.\n\u2193\n1831993081056379054 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \ud83d\udc9c 1\nbut seriously guys this is the second anonymous pamphlet, and this brotherhood is secret, so people started looking for Rosicrucians. (Who will raise their hand?) People across Europe claim to have met them. Letters are written by people trying to make contact\n\u2193\n1831993439681957911 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \ud83d\udc9c 2\nno public confirmation of the group's existence is ever made. Which just adds to the mystique and the meme \ud83e\udd14\n\nRemember, society is ripe, it wants to transform, so all of this speculation becomes part of the actual transformation whether or not the Rosicrucians are real!\n\u2193\n1831994108971262100 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \ud83d\udc9c 2 [(SEED) type=quote_of_root]\nthe Confessio actually feeding back into the actual transformation in society at the time is a great historical large scale example of \"joke about the outcomes you want\"\n\nyou can think the whole thing is a hoax or a joke...still worked\n\nhttps://t.co/bjcf2uu6yi\n  [Quoting @visakanv: the stuff you joke about (even ironically or whatever) has a way of shaping your reality so be careful and deliberate with that stuff. a lot of people out here fumbling their own bags by joking about outcomes they don\u2019t want. you might as well joke about the outcomes you do want]\n\u2193\n1831994503961391542 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \nunsurprisingly Confessio, essentially a meme pamphlet, became extremely influential in the time period because it expressed the zeitgeist and promised society what they secretly most desired: transformation, freedom from old orthodoxy, the dawning of a new positive age\n\u2193\n1831994890818887938 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \nremember; this is 1615, the Martin Luther reformation had happened about 100 years before, and that \"New Age\" that got promised by the Rosicrucians?  It got delivered!\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a screenshot of a Wikipedia page about the Age of Enlightenment, featuring a title, three images, and a brief description. \n    \n    The title \"Age of Enlightenment\" is displayed in white text at the top left, accompanied by a small icon to its left. To the right of the title are three buttons: \"Overview\", \"Videos\", and \"Purpose\". Below the title and buttons are three images depicting scenes from the Enlightenment era, showcasing people in formal attire gathered in rooms. \n    \n    Underneath the images is a paragraph of white text on a black background that reads: \"The Enlightenment featured a range of social ideas centered on the value of knowledge learned by way of rationalism and of empiricism and political ideals such as natural law, liberty, and progress, toleration and fraternity, constitutional government, and the formal separation of church and state.\"\n\u2193\n1831995517145895182 [2024-09-06] @forthrighter \ud83d\udc9c 1\nthis \ud83e\uddf5 isn't asking you to believe in the actual literal existence of a brotherhood of alchemists who changed the world behind some veil of secrecy, but the mere suggestion of it did actually create ripples &amp; impact https://t.co/bQDh9CGhi8\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image depicts a still from an animated movie or series, showing three robed figures standing around a large, ornate object.

The arc spans 2020-2025, beginning with a throwaway joke about Mark Zuckerberg doing MMA, crystallizing into the core thesis in May 2021, then evolving through 50+ numbered examples where jokes-become-reality (Trump's presidency, Omicron as 'natural vaccine,' meeting partners at Vibecamp).
