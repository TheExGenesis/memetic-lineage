And how does society change tech?\n\u2193\n1338963131889020930 [2020-12-15] @RhysLindmark \n2/ We can start with the original tech &lt;&gt; society loop:\n\nMarx's Base and Superstructure. This is the core reinforcing loop of capitalism.\n\nBase : Tech ::\nSuperstructure : Society https://t.co/VRwCy74PmK\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a diagram illustrating the concept of Marx's Base and Superstructure, a fundamental idea in Marxist theory. The diagram consists of two main sections: \"Superstructure\" and \"Base,\" which are connected by arrows to demonstrate their interrelationship.\n    \n    *   **Superstructure**\n        *   Everything not directly related to production\n        *   Includes:\n            *   Art\n            *   Family\n            *   Culture\n            *   Religion\n            *   Philosophy\n            *   Ideology\n            *   Law\n            *   Media\n            *   Politics\n            *   Science\n            *   Education\n    *   **Base**\n        *   Means of Production:\n            *   Tools\n            *   Machines\n            *   Factories\n            *   Land\n            *   Raw materials\n        *   Relations of Production:\n            *   Lumpen-Proletariat\n            *   Proletariat\n            *   Labour Aristocracy\n            *   Petty-Bourgeoisie\n            *   Bourgeoisie\n            *   Private property\n            *   Capital\n            *   Commodities\n            *   etc.\n    *   **Relationship between Superstructure and Base**\n        *   The Superstructure maintains (and shapes) the Base.\n        *   The Base shapes (and maintains) the Superstructure.\n        *   This relationship moves in a spiral pattern, with the Base being generally dominant.\n    \n    In summary, the diagram illustrates the complex interplay between the Superstructure and the Base, highlighting how they influence and shape each other. The Superstructure encompasses various aspects of society that are not directly related to production, while the Base comprises the means and relations of production. The arrows connecting the two sections demonstrate their reciprocal relationship, with the Base being the dominant force. Overall, the diagram provides a visual representation of Marx's Base and Superstructure, offering insights into the dynamics of societal structures and their impact on one another.\n\u2193\n1338963137513598976 [2020-12-15] @RhysLindmark \n3/ Staying at the abstract level, we can formally define the concept of a paradigm:\n\nA paradigm is the feedback loop between epistemology, ontology, and ethics.\n\nWe're changing how we understand the world, as the underlying world itself changes, as our goals change. https://t.co/ix7MxCEBm0\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a hand-drawn diagram on a blackboard, illustrating the interconnectedness of three concepts: Epistemology, Ontology, and Ethics.\n    \n    *   **Epistemology**\n        *   Written in white chalk at the top left of the image.\n        *   A green glowing symbol is drawn below it, accompanied by a dashed line that connects to the center of the image.\n    *   **Ontology**\n        *   Positioned in the center of the image, with the word \"ONTOLOGY\" written above it in white chalk.\n        *   A yellow glowing cube is drawn below the label, representing the concept of Ontology.\n        *   Dashed lines connect the cube to the Epistemology and Ethics sections.\n    *   **Ethics**\n        *   Located at the top right of the image, with the word \"ETHICS\" written in white chalk.\n        *   Two red glowing question marks are drawn below it, connected to the Ontology section by arrows.\n    *   **Background and Additional Elements**\n        *   The background of the image features a blackboard with small white dots, resembling a starry night sky.\n        *   In the bottom-right corner, a white rectangle contains the text \"RHYS\" in black letters.\n    \n    The diagram illustrates the relationships between Epistemology, Ontology, and Ethics, suggesting that they are interconnected and influence one another. The use of different colors and symbols adds visual interest and helps to distinguish between the three concepts.\n\u2193\n1338963143754731525 [2020-12-15] @RhysLindmark \n4/ As a specific example, we can see this paradigm change from the Industrial Age to the Information Age. https://t.co/VpUSHlGfBH\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a hand-drawn illustration that compares three different ideologies: Broadcast, Factoryism, and Liberalism. The image is divided into three sections, each representing one of the ideologies.\n    \n    *   **Broadcast**\n        *   The left section is labeled \"BROADCAST\" and features a blue cone with a flag on top, containing the number 10.\n        *   The cone is surrounded by a glow effect, symbolizing the broadcasting of information or messages.\n        *   The number 10 inside the cone may represent a specific message or signal being broadcasted.\n    *   **Factoryism**\n        *   The middle section is labeled \"FACTORYISM\" and depicts a yellow figure with a star on its head, surrounded by three smaller cones labeled \"3\".\n        *   The figure has its arms outstretched, and the cones are positioned below it, suggesting a hierarchical structure.\n        *   The word \"ATOMS\" is written below the figure, implying a connection to the concept of atoms or individual components.\n    *   **Liberalism**\n        *   The right section is labeled \"LIBERALISM\" and shows a red figure with outstretched arms and legs, surrounded by arrows pointing in different directions.\n        *   The figure is accompanied by the text \"GOOD FOR SELF?\" in red, suggesting a focus on individualism and self-interest.\n        *   The overall design of this section conveys a sense of freedom and decentralization.\n    \n    In summary, the image presents a visual comparison of three ideologies, each represented by a unique symbol and color scheme. The Broadcast section emphasizes the dissemination of information, while the Factoryism section highlights a hierarchical structure and the importance of individual components. The Liberalism section focuses on individualism and self-interest, with a sense of freedom and decentralization. Overall, the image provides a thought-provoking visual representation of these complex ideologies.\n\u2193\n1338963147877707779 [2020-12-15] @RhysLindmark \n5/ Getting more specific, we can view societal evolution from @JoHenrich's perspective of cultural evolution.\n\nCultural evolution can be understood as biology co-evolving with our culture.\n\nWe need culture-bio fit. Marriage norms (culture) are anchored to our pair-bonding bio. https://t.co/CyE3EyzJhk\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a simple digital illustration that depicts the concept of culture and biology being interconnected. \n    \n    * The main focus of the image is a white-outlined puzzle piece graphic with two interlocking pieces, one labeled \"CULTURE\" and the other labeled \"BIOLOGY\".\n    \t+ The top piece is teal-colored and has the word \"CULTURE\" written in white handwritten-style text.\n    \t+ The bottom piece is yellow-green colored and has the word \"BIOLOGY\" written in white handwritten-style text.\n    * The background of the image is dark blue with small white dots scattered throughout, resembling a starry night sky.\n    * In the bottom-right corner, there is a small white rectangle with the name \"RHYS\" written in black handwritten-style text.\n    \n    The image effectively conveys the idea that culture and biology are closely linked and interdependent, much like the two interlocking puzzle pieces.\n\u2193\n1338963152051052544 [2020-12-15] @RhysLindmark \n6/ If we zoom in, bio can be seen as genetics, ontogeny, and psych, while culture can be seen as norms and institutions. https://t.co/IeC0q2FKJG\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a simple stick figure drawing with text and arrows, set against a black background with white dots.\n    \n    *   The stick figure is drawn in white and has a smiling face. It is positioned centrally in the image.\n        *   The figure is labeled \"INNER BIOLOGICAL\" on the left side of its head.\n        *   An arrow points to the right from the figure's head, with the words \"GENETICS \u2192 ONTOGENY \u2192 PSYCHOLOGY\" written above it.\n        *   Another arrow points to the right from the first arrow, with the words \"NORMS \u2192 INSTITUTIONS\" written above it.\n        *   The label \"OUTER SOCIAL\" is written to the right of the second arrow.\n    *   The background of the image is black with small white dots scattered throughout.\n        *   In the bottom-right corner, there is a small white rectangle with the word \"RHYS\" written inside it.\n    \n    The image appears to be illustrating the relationship between biological and social factors, with the stick figure representing an individual and the arrows indicating the progression from inner biological processes to outer social influences.\n\u2193\n1338963156421537793 [2020-12-15] @RhysLindmark \n7/ These different layers move at different speeds. e.g. Institutions and genetics are slow. https://t.co/GYQ3ZI8npU\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a simple, hand-drawn diagram illustrating the concept of different layers moving at varying speeds. The diagram consists of five curved lines, each representing a distinct layer, labeled from top to bottom as \"Institutions\", \"Norms\", \"Psychology\", \"Ontogeny\", and \"Genetics\". \n    \n    *   The lines are drawn in white on a black background with small white dots, resembling a starry night sky.\n    *   Each line has an arrow pointing to the right, indicating movement or progression.\n    *   The lines are not parallel, with the top line being the longest and the bottom line being the shortest, suggesting that the layers move at different speeds.\n    *   The labels are written in a handwritten-style font, adding a personal touch to the diagram.\n    *   In the bottom-right corner, there is a small white rectangle with the text \"RHYS\" inside, likely indicating the creator or author of the diagram.\n    \n    Overall, the diagram effectively conveys the idea that different aspects of human society and biology operate on different timescales, with institutions and genetics being the slowest and fastest, respectively.\n\u2193\n1338963160137670661 [2020-12-15] @RhysLindmark \n8/ This should remind you of @stewartbrand's Pace Layers https://t.co/3esB2rv7Hm\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a diagram illustrating \"Pace Layering,\" a concept developed by Stewart Brand. The diagram consists of six curved layers, each representing a different aspect of society, stacked on top of one another.\n    \n    To reproduce this diagram, start by drawing a large rectangle with a double border. Inside the rectangle, draw six curved lines, each one larger than the last, to represent the different layers. Label each layer in order from top to bottom: \"FASHION,\" \"COMMERCE,\" \"INFRASTRUCTURE,\" \"GOVERNANCE,\" \"CULTURE,\" and \"NATURE.\"\n    \n    The top layer, \"FASHION,\" should be depicted with wavy lines and arrows indicating movement. Draw arrows pointing from the top layer to the ones below it, suggesting the flow of influence from one layer to the next. The arrows should be directed downward, indicating that the top layers influence the bottom ones.\n    \n    At the bottom of the rectangle, include the source information: \"Source: Brand, S., 1999, The Clock of the Long Now, p. 37.\" The background of the diagram should be white, with black lines and text.\n    \n    The resulting diagram will illustrate the concept of Pace Layering, showing how different aspects of society interact and influence one another.\n\u2193\n1338963163329531906 [2020-12-15] @RhysLindmark \n9/ Henrich's book mostly focuses on WEIRD psychology. He writes: \"The cultural evolution of psychology is the dark matter that flows behind the scenes throughout history.\"\n\nWEIRD psych co-evolved with voluntary orgs from 1000-2000 in Europe. Old kin institutions were outcompeted. https://t.co/mL6s6HFB0A\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image is a flowchart illustrating the relationship between Western Christianity and various societal and psychological factors. The chart is divided into several sections, each representing a different aspect of this relationship.\n    \n    *   **Western Christianity competes with other religions**\n        *   This section serves as the starting point of the flowchart.\n        *   It highlights the competitive nature of Western Christianity with other religious beliefs.\n    *   **Marriage and Family Program**\n        *   Monogamous marriage only\n        *   No arranged marriage\n        *   No kin marriage (affines, etc.)\n        *   Neolocal residence\n        *   Inheritance by testament\n        *   Individual ownership\n        *   No adoption\n        *   This section outlines the characteristics of the marriage and family program associated with Western Christianity.\n    *   **Social consequences**\n        *   Dissolution of intensive kinship\n        *   Weaker ties to extended kin\n        *   Weaker ties to lands\n        *   Relational and residential mobility\n        *   Greater dependence on Church\n        *   Need for safety nets\n        *   This section describes the social implications of adopting the marriage and family program.\n    *   **Psychological consequences, self-focus**\n        *   Individualism, self-focus\n        *   Analytical thinking\n        *   Guilt > Shame\n        *   Normative conformity\n        *   Intentional morality\n        *   Zero-sum thinking & status-seeking\n        *   Impatience and risk-seeking\n        *   This section details the psychological effects of the marriage and family program on individuals.\n    *   **Impersonal markets and urbanization**\n        *   Greater mobile division of labor\n        *   Greater dependence on formal institutions and contracts\n        *   First religiously affiliated and then secular social safety nets\n        *   This section discusses the impact of the marriage and family program on economic and social structures.\n    *   **Competition among voluntary associations**\n        *   Competition among cities, towns, guilds, monasteries, universities, and businesses\n        *   Favors institutions built to engage and reinforce WEIRD psychology\n        *   This section explains how competition among various voluntary associations influences the development of WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) psychology.\n    *   **Psychological consequences**\n        *   Impersonal prosociality\n        *   Interpersonal prosociality\n        *   Impartial rules and principles\n        *   Patience (delay discounting)\n        *   Time\n\u2193\n1338963166454312960 [2020-12-15] @RhysLindmark \ud83d\udc9c 1\n10/ I don't mind Henrich's causal loop diagram above.

The map (group size \u00d7 duration) provides a developmental framework for hosting capacity, sparking dialectical refinement (missing z-axes, periodicity debates) and practical application (people plotting their own trajectories, validating years later with \"made it\" posts). The arc shows high cohesion around a core network (Rich, Visa, Malcolm, Tasshin) building shared vocabulary for scaling social contexts, culminating in real-world execution (Portal campus, coliving experiments) that validates the original 2020 aspiration of \"100-year games\" without aggressive monetization.",
