THIS IS CLASSIC PRISONER'S DILEMMA. RED PILL IS THE RATIONAL CHOICE.\"\n\u2502               *   This character represents the average person who is aware of the Prisoner's Dilemma and has made a rational decision to choose the red pill.\n\u2502           *   The character on the right has an IQ score of 145 and is labeled \"BLUE PILL.

By referencing the Prisoner's Dilemma, the meme suggests that the rational choice may not always be the most desirable outcome. Overall, the image is a thought-provoking commentary on the human condition, encouraging viewers to consider the implications of their choices and the potential consequences of their decisions.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 1690944715548725248 [2023-08-14] @IsaacKing314 \ud83d\udc9c 491 \ud83d\udd01 12\n\u2502   @lisatomic5 Wow, I did not expect these results.

We don't live in that world. Many people, certainly billions, would instinctively choose blue, believing it to be the moral choice. Thus, if you choose red, billions die. The tension lies in knowing that red is the optimal choice with coordination and that it carries no personal risk. But it *does* carry a risk: that your choice of red will result in the deaths of billions of people.  One of the reasons I would choose blue is that the world where we killed all of the 'blues' for making a suboptimal choice would be a much worse world to live in than this one.

The graph is accompanied by three cartoon characters and features a red and blue color scheme.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       *   The graph is a bell curve, which is a graphical representation of a normal distribution.\n\u2502           *   The x-axis represents IQ scores, ranging from 55 to 145.\n\u2502           *   The y-axis represents the percentage of people with corresponding IQ scores.\n\u2502           *   The graph is divided into two sections: the left side is colored blue, while the right side is colored red.\n\u2502           *   The percentages for each section of the graph are as follows:\n\u2502               *   0.1%: IQ score of 55 (left) and 145 (right)\n\u2502               *   2%: IQ score of 70 (left) and 130 (right)\n\u2502               *   14%: IQ score of 85 (left) and 115 (right)\n\u2502               *   34%: IQ score of 100 (left and right)\n\u2502       *   Three cartoon characters are placed around the graph.\n\u2502           *   The character on the left has an IQ score of 55 and is depicted with a simple, primitive appearance.\n\u2502           *   The character in the middle has an IQ score of 100 and is shown with a mix of emotions, including happiness and sadness.\n\u2502           *   The character on the right has an IQ score of 145 and is illustrated wearing a hooded cloak, giving off a mysterious and intelligent vibe.\n\u2502       *   The background of the image is white, providing a clean and neutral backdrop for the graph and cartoon characters.\n\u2502       \n\u2502       In summary, the image is a humorous take on the concept of IQ scores, using a bell curve graph to illustrate the distribution of intelligence among the population. The accompanying cartoon characters add a lighthearted touch, poking fun at the idea that IQ scores can be used to categorize individuals into different groups.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 1691119839006556160 [2023-08-14] @alicemazzy \ud83d\udc9c 213\n\u2502   @lisatomic5 your 12yo is a top decile poster\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 1691148092790157328 [2023-08-14] @sympatheticopp \ud83d\udc9c 28\n\u2502   @lisatomic5 so you're the little lady who started this big war....\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 1691149780053798931 [2023-08-14] @nic__carter \ud83d\udc9c 143 \ud83d\udd01 3\n\u2502   @lisatomic5 couldnt smash red fast enough\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 1691166685146025987 [2023-08-14] @goblinodds \ud83d\udc9c 41 \ud83d\udd01 2\n\u2502   @lisatomic5 this is the best thing since @browserdotsys waged war on the crows\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 1691177506663989248 [2023-08-14] @aashiq \ud83d\udc9c 18\n\u2502   @lisatomic5 Voted red, even though I thought people would vote blue.

The table is divided into three sections, each representing different conditions: \"(you might slip),\" \"(you have steady hands),\" and \"(you slip).\" \n    \n    To reproduce this table, one would need to create a grid with the following structure:\n    \n    *   The leftmost column lists \"Others' choices\" with values ranging from 4 to 0, indicating the number of others choosing red or blue.\n    *   The top row has three main sections: \"Your choice (you might slip),\" \"Your choice (you have steady hands),\" and \"Your choice (you slip).\" Each of these sections is further divided into two sub-columns labeled \"red (you hope)\" and \"blue (you hope)\" for the first two sections, and \"red...? blue!\" and \"blue...? red!\" for the third section.\n    *   The cells within the table contain percentages and numbers. The percentages represent the probability of a particular outcome, while the numbers seem to represent payoffs or scores associated with those outcomes.\n    \n    The table is filled with specific values, such as percentages and payoffs, which are color-coded. For example, under \"(you might slip),\" when \"Others' choices\" are \"4 red 0 blue,\" choosing \"red\" yields a 99% chance of a payoff of 103, while choosing \"blue\" gives a 0.1% chance of a payoff of 0 and a 0% chance of a payoff of 5.\n    \n    To accurately reproduce the table, one would need to fill in the exact percentages and payoffs as shown in the original image, ensuring that the color-coding is consistent with the original. The color scheme used includes red, blue, green, and beige, which correspond to different outcomes or probabilities.\n    \n    The context provided by the tweet suggests that the table is being used to analyze a game or decision-making scenario where the probability of error is 1%. The user valued \"own life\" at 100 and \"each friends' life\" at 1, indicating a significant personal stake in the outcome. The tweet also mentions achieving an equilibrium at 100% blue, suggesting that the analysis led to a stable state where all players choose blue.\n\u2193\n1692037839909683543 [2023-08-17] @Malcolm_Ocean \ud83d\udc9c 3\nI did another one with the error rate set to 10%, and interestingly this makes the one where half of the other people pick red/blue switch in valence\n\nthis is partially a function of the ratio between own &amp; friends' lives https://t.co/gcUYkL6H3q\nImages:\n  - [Image #0] The image presents a table titled \"Payoffs in a world where error is 10%,\" which appears to be a payoff matrix for a game or decision-making scenario. The table is divided into three sections, each representing different conditions: \"(you might slip),\" \"(you have steady hands),\" and \"(you slip).\" \n    \n    To reproduce this table, one would need to create a 3x8 grid with the following elements:\n    \n    *   The leftmost column lists the \"Others' choices\" with varying combinations of red and blue, ranging from 4 red 0 blue to 0 red 4 blue.\n    *   The top row of each section contains the \"Your choice\" options: \"red (you hope)\" and \"blue (you hope)\" for the first section, \"red\" and \"blue\" for the second, and \"red...? blue!\" and \"blue...? red!\" for the third.\n    *   Each cell within the grid contains a percentage value and two numerical values, likely representing payoffs or outcomes based on the combination of \"Others' choices\" and \"Your choice.\"\n    *   The percentages and numerical values are color-coded, with red, blue, and green used to highlight specific outcomes or probabilities.\n    \n    The table seems to illustrate how different choices and error rates affect payoffs in a game or decision-making context.

The discourse evolves from initial visceral responses (\"Blue = compassion, Red = intelligence\") through sophisticated game-theoretic analysis (Nash equilibria, trembling hand, framing effects) to meta-level insights about how humans actually coordinate in practice. Unlike a static debate, the strand produces genuine knowledge artifacts: Malcolm Ocean's extensive framing experiments, Yash's \"costly signaling\" theory, and the discovery that tiny amounts of noise make Blue objectively superior. The arc is constructive rather than purely dialectical\u2014participants refine rather than destroy each other's positions, ultimately converging on \"context-dependent rationality\" as the synthesis.",
