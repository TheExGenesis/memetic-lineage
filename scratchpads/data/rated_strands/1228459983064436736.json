    "reasoning_summary": "This strand is a multi-year meditation on the 'Treehouse Guy' archetype\u2014a viral tweet by @imbethmccoll (2020) that crystallized a counterintuitive sexual/romantic truth: that unbothered, low-status, non-conformist men often provide transcendent experiences. The boundary object is the original tweet itself, which becomes a recurring meme/reference point. The arc is *iterative rather than evolutionary*\u2014the community repeatedly returns to this idea across 5+ years, applying it to new contexts (unemployment-cortisol hypothesis, sex positivity discourse, Buddhist saints, rationalist orgy culture). It's more of a 'sustained riff' than a dialectical refinement, though it does spawn useful sub-concepts like 'treehouse energy' and 'surreal unbotheredness.' High cohesion (same core users), medium utility (provides vocabulary for a real phenomenon but doesn't build new frameworks).",
