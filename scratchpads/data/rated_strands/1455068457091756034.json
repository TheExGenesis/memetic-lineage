    "reasoning_summary": "This strand traces the multi-year evolution of a psychological/somatic concept anchored by RomeoStevens76's 'Ice Cream Probability Shape' tweet (2021). The boundary object is the metaphor of childhood conditioning creating lifelong muscle tension patterns. The discourse is primarily constructive\u2014practitioners of Alexander Technique, somatic therapies, and contemplative practice use the tweet as a shared reference point to explore how early conditioning manifests as physical tension, and how to release it. The arc moves from initial recognition (Qiaochu's 2019 pre-context on school conditioning) through Romeo's crystallization, into practical applications (Rich's TRE/MDMA experiments, Yatharth's 'Walmart problem'), and finally theoretical synthesis (Johnsonmxe's vasomuscular computation model). The strand demonstrates high evolution\u2014from abstract critique to embodied practice to mechanistic theory\u2014and high utility for both the contemplative community and outsiders seeking to understand psychosomatic patterns.",
