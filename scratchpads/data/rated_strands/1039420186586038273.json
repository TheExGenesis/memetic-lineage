Anchored by Visa's 2018 thread distinguishing 'noob' vs 'friend' communication patterns, it evolved from personal observation into a teachable framework adopted across communities. The discourse is constructive rather than dialectical: participants build on the core insight ('support the OP, disagree well') by applying it to contexts like improv theater, bid theory, Twitter growth strategy, and even internal note-taking. The boundary object is the original thread itself, which gets repeatedly cited as people recognize reply game as a learnable skill with compounding returns.
