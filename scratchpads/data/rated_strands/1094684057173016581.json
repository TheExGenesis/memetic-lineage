It combines elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, interactive fiction, and online chat.\n\u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   1094687116796125186 [2019-02-10] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 193 \ud83d\udd01 10 \ud83d\udcac 1\n\u2502   Players can read, view and contribute descriptions of objects, other players, non-player characters, and actions performed in the virtual world, as well as the \u201creal\u201d world.

Conflict between players with different interpretations of Twitter is a key feature of Twitter itself. Indeed, one of the most popular games is \u201chey, fuck that guy\u201d.\n\u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   1094691177289281536 [2019-02-10] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 216 \ud83d\udd01 9 \ud83d\udcac 1\n\u2502   Unsurprisingly, few players put much thought into precisely defining the game that they are playing.

Any player can reply to any other player\u2019s tweets, or retweet it, or quote-tweet it. This bypasses traditional limitations of both \u201creal life\u201d as well as older web mediums like \u201cblogs\u201d.\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   \u2502   1094697463301079041 [2019-02-10] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 195 \ud83d\udd01 12\n\u2502   \u2502   Twitter is also searchable, and allows tweets to be \u201cthreaded\u201d in chains. \n\u2502   \u2502   \n\u2502   \u2502   This allows skilled players to build incredibly complex tapestries of hypertext, consisting of thousands of tweets.\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   \u2502   1094698711618269184 [2019-02-10] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 210 \ud83d\udd01 13\n\u2502   \u2502   Why would such prolific players choose Twitter as a medium, rather than \u201cwebsites\u201d or \u201cbooks\u201d, which appear to be better suited to large volumes of content?\n\u2502   \u2502   \n\u2502   \u2502   Because Twitter allows any player to interact with any other player\u2019s tweets.\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   \u2502   1094699709027905545 [2019-02-10] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 398 \ud83d\udd01 38 \ud83d\udcac 4\n\u2502   \u2502   Most casual players do not appear to have caught on to the true potential utility of Twitter, or perhaps they are indifferent to it. \n\u2502   \u2502   \n\u2502   \u2502   A web of tweets is a living entity that allows players to meet, interact and engage with 1000s of others *at the level of individual thoughts*.\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   \u2502   1094701060462075904 [2019-02-10] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 206 \ud83d\udd01 13\n\u2502   \u2502   Properly constructed, a web of tweets allows you to:\n\u2502   \u2502   \n\u2502   \u2502   - witness how other players discover your tweets, via their patterns of Likes, RTs, QTs\n\u2502   \u2502   \n\u2502   \u2502   - connect each fragmented thought and experience into a part of a greater whole\n\u2502   \u2502   \n\u2502   \u2502   - recognise and embellish patterns in your own play\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1865972747404267803 [2024-12-09] @ultimape \ud83d\udc9c 5\n\u2502       @visakanv Trying to go viral is an emergent twitter puzzle game that manny people don't realize they are playing.https://t.co/7Jk8LR11EQ\n\u2502         [Quoting Tweet 1865795808811172190 (missing)]\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 1094701265068740609 [2019-02-10] @nabeelqu \ud83d\udc9c 2\n\u2502   @visakanv I love this\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 1094765023489069058 [2019-02-11] @smart_intellecc \ud83d\udc9c 9\n\u2502   @visakanv @sonyaellenmann Are there any good Twitter speed runs?\n\u2502   \u2193\n\u2502   1094847667903971329 [2019-02-11] @visakanv \ud83d\udc9c 9\n\u2502   @smart_intellecc @sonyaellenmann https://t.co/ppfLJlp0lT\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 1115209716484005889 [2019-04-08] @mwiik \ud83d\udc9c 2\n\u2502   @visakanv Interesting stuff.

(also that any individual tweet can itself be a QT!) \n\nwhat this means is that it\u2019s worth learning how to write threads in such a way that every individual tweet stands somewhat on its own, and makes sense and says something comprehensible even when RT\u2019d / QT\u2019d outside the context of the rest of the thread. ideally (imo) each tweet in a thread should make exactly one point or introduce exactly one new idea - they get very cluttered if you try to say too much at once. the thread as a whole serves as a journey through the individual ideas or points in each tweet, and can also offer detours via QTs to other threads. one of the cool things learning how to thread like this does is that you can be surprised by which tweets in a thread resonate with other people - maybe you had a grand conclusion but it\u2019s a throwaway tweet in the middle that people actually RT and QT and reply to. this is a level of granularity of feedback on your writing and ideas that longform doesn\u2019t support by default (although google doc comments can be even more granular, eg) and i\u2019ve learned a lot from it\n\nfrom this perspective long tweets offer a return back to longform, but somewhat more casual longform than eg a \u2018stack post. sometimes you wanna describe an idea that takes longer than 280 chars to meaningfully express. sometimes you wanna ramble and think out loud in a less structured way than a thread (this is what i\u2019m doing rn). threads also have the disadvantage that if you do too good a job making the individual tweets stand alone then when they get RT\u2019d and QT\u2019d they may not even look like part of a thread, so people may not even click through to the rest of it. long tweets have the advantage (and disadvantage) that the whole thing is RT\u2019d or QT\u2019d at once, meaning it\u2019s harder to single out individual bits but the whole package gets transported around twitter together, and unlike an external link it\u2019s all still happening on twitter. typically when i write long threads the first tweet gets RT\u2019d and QT\u2019d the most and all the numbers drop off from there. so i\u2019m interested in the ability of long tweets to preserve what might otherwise be a chopped-up thread as more of an organic whole. anyway that\u2019s what i\u2019ve got so far, time to get some food now. thanks for reading\n\u2193\n1755072676811685951 [2024-02-07] @QiaochuYuan \ud83d\udc9c 16 [(SEED) type=quote_of_root]\nkinda wish this was a thread, the stuff in the middle about threading would be worth having in its own separate tweets so i could QT it later, and also it would've been nice to be able to QT the strategy guide\n\nhttps://t.co/0fFpE2XKRL\n  [Quoting @visakanv: twitter_rpg_strategy_guide.txt]\n\n===\n\n1798422482845901020 [2024-06-05] @VividVoid_ \ud83d\udc9c 312 \ud83d\udd01 2\nWhat are the great load-bearing TPOT posts?
