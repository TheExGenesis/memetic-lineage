The section outlines the characteristics of the XY problem, including:\n    \n    * The user wants to achieve X but doesn't know how.\n    * The user thinks they can solve X if they can just figure out Y.\n    * The user doesn't know how to do Y either.\n    * The user asks for help with Y.\n    * Others try to assist with Y, but are confused because it seems like a strange problem.\n    * After much interaction and wasted time, it becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn't even a suitable solution for X.\n    \n    The problem arises when people get stuck on what they believe is the solution and are unable to step back and explain the issue in full.\n    \n    **What to do about it?**\n    \n    This section provides guidance on how to address the XY problem.

The boundary object is psychological defense mechanisms masquerading as unsolvable problems. The arc spans 2011-2025, evolving from Visa's early observations about identity-as-pain (Tolle quote) through DRMacIver's crystallization of the concept, to widespread adoption as a diagnostic tool for stuck patterns. This is primarily constructive\u2014the community builds shared vocabulary ('incompetence as competence,' 'maladjustment as political act') and applies the frame across domains (relationships, creativity, addiction, social media use). High cohesion around rationalist/postrat networks. The evolution is medium-to-high: the core insight remains stable, but applications deepen (Rival's hyperrationality-as-defense, Malcolm's coherence therapy integration, Yatharth's somatic dimension). Utility is high for therapeutic/coaching contexts but requires significant sophistication to deploy without causing defensiveness.",
