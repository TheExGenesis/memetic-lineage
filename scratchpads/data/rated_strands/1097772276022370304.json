It's multifaceted.\n\u2193\n1132758088442961926 [2019-05-26] @ultimape \nFor some, \"capitalism\" represents Jeffersonian whiteness - often representing a disgust with how colonialism and male driven systems of rule leaked over from Europe as people reconstituted British law here in the states. It takes the same connotation as \"white man's burden\".\n\u2193\n1132758607865556992 [2019-05-26] @ultimape \nBut for others it is more about racial boundary - with skin colour being a defining factor. The conflict arises when one group's language is referring to cultural moors and systems of rule, and another group is thinking about racial purity. There are groups viewing both as true.\n\u2193\n1132759467035156480 [2019-05-26] @ultimape \nThere is also hints of 'power' - how one group rules another with social forces (stuff like creeping gentrification, culture destroying social policing etc) end up swaying the way groups make meaning.

The discourse is primarily constructive rather than dialectical\u2014people building on and applying the core insight rather than challenging it. The diagram itself becomes a memetic artifact that gets quoted/shared across years (2019-2025), with participants like Malcolm Ocean, Tasshin, Rich Decibels, and others extending it into domains like cult offramps, embodiment debates, and interpersonal mediation. The strand shows high cohesion (recurring cast returning to the same framework) and medium-high utility (practical conversational tools), but evolution is somewhat limited\u2014the core insight remains static while applications multiply.",
