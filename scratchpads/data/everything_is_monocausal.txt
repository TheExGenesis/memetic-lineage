        Practically, it makes sense. If you can generate a critical mass in public sentiment while there's a salient rallying cry, you might be able to effect a preference cascade
        
        And if you might end up on the potential butt end of that cascade it's important to be extremely vocal too

just listened to a podcast where glenn loury interviews james heckman (!!!) about racial economic outcome differences

specifically around iq vs (other things) 

if you're a patron I'd recommend listening, else wait until it drops on @bloggingheads in a few days

got me thinking

    Heckman's thing is basically emphasising the importance of  what you might call moral development (contra two other major narratives about causes of outcome differentials, IQ and oppression)
    
    in some ways this is the most appealing story one could tell

                what dawned on me fairly quickly as Heckman went along was that in fact this is at Least as dark as the other stories and possibly moreso

                    the first issue is probably well covered but it runs roughly "well what you're more or less saying is that black people are terrible parents and communities, utterly failing to raise their children"

                        the second is that all of the policy solutions are unspeakably horrifying
                        
                        Heckman goes on and on about how valuable a good mother is to a child, how this work is underappreciated
                        
                        lets suppose this is true
                        
                        what do you suggest we do? find new, better mothers for black kids?

                            @eigenrobot one possible policy measure is to end the drug war so that the kids get a chance to grow up around adult men, preferably their fathers

this is maybe worth elaborating on in more detail. there's a term i picked up from CFAR, "overlearning," which was used to refer to where you learn a new concept and suddenly start to see it everywhere, like "oh shit is everything just trauma" etc. https://t.co/rl9kDVXaIC

            just worth keeping in mind that ideally it should be temporary. at some point you've 80-20'd the concept or it's no longer your new edge / bottleneck and you can give yourself permission to move on to something else (obviously talking to myself here)

story sounds good, doesnt actually work out this way

polytheistic pagan societies such as egypt and aztecs and incas were quite absolutist. greco-roman nations uniformly started as kingdoms

        scott gamely allows that christian culture of the past might be desirable in some real if second-order ways, but argues that we can't go back
        
        and even if we could that wouldn't help because last time things just degenerated from there in a few generations

                            the first is that such a successful christianity would almost necessarily have incorporated and digested modern and postmodern critiques, if those were indeed the issue (and yeah I'll take the left bell curve stance that they probably had a lot to do with it)

                                        that is, granting arguendo that the cultural frisson of the antebellum world required christianity, it still seems likely to me that christianity was not _sufficient_
