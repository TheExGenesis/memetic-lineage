Further links and footnotes over at my blog, link to that in the following comment.  Who Are You Going To Believe? Everything Everyone Says Plus Everything You See, or Some Science-Illiterate Jerks?  As I talk about frequently on this blog1, autistic people have a natural tendency to believe that when other people say things they are trying to truthfully communicate what they actually believe. Because otherwise what\u2019s the point?? Several friends say \u201cYes ok, but you have eyes, right? You can see things yourself?\u201d  Can I? What is it I saw, when I looked around?  I grew up in a suburb of a small Blue city in the 90s. I did not see men fighting women. My time was spent in school where teachers interact via words and chalkboards. My peers were children and their strength was proportional to what grade they were in, not their sex. My siblings were younger than me, so weaker. My babysitter was older than me, so she was stronger. All adults were functionally infinitely strong.  At recess I read books. I opted out of gym as much as possible, it was humiliating and vulgar. The only post-puberty phys ed class I was forced to take was sex segregated so I wouldn't have had any opportunity to see differences. In earlier gym classes I didn\u2019t look around much. Why would I? Are people comparing themselves to see how many jumping jacks they can do? I just wanted it to be done with.  I didn\u2019t watch sports, but even when I was exposed to them they were already sex-segregated, so how could I have observed that women are having a hard time against men? Mostly I just noticed that women were excluded from sports altogether. I was told this was due to sexism, which lined up with everything I had been told about the world, so obviously it was true.  But the Olympics!! What about the Olympics?  Men don\u2019t compete against women, so a casual watching of a nearby TV during a conversation doesn\u2019t give any observations. To notice a difference I would have to look for the reported numbers somewhere on the screen, write them down, and compare them across the events. Again, this is not a level of interest I held/hold for sports.  OK, but what about all of media everywhere?  I grew up in the 90s. My media diet consisted of awesome stuff like Aliens, Terminator 2, Buffy, Xena, Dark Angel, the various Star Treks, The Matrix, Farscape etc. The rule for who kicked ass was \"the one that's the main character.\" If an action movie or series had a woman in it, she kicked ass.  My books were science fiction and fantasy and Marvel. What determined the winner of a fight wasn\u2019t muscles, it was cybernetics and laser guns, or dark rituals and spell books and magic swords, or getting the best mutation.  The very earliest RPG I played did have a tiny points-neutral modifier for sex, but by the time I bought my  second computer game even that was gone. Stats were allocated by the player, and could be modified by race (elf/dwarf/orc, human/ghoul/supermutant) but never by sex. Sex was purely an aesthetic choice. Why would whether you have a dick or not affect how hard you can swing a sword?  The one difference everyone did admit to was men have a modest advantage in upper-body strength, so they\u2019ll do more pushups and pull-ups than women can.  So yes, everywhere I looked, men and women were basically identical. It\u2019s actually very easy to not get any evidence of male physical advantage if you don\u2019t spend much time interacting with the physical world and all your second-hand sources are politely not drawing attention to the embarrassingly unequal parts of reality. And every disparity that does exist is easily attributed to the deep sexism of society which is as well established as the heliocentric model of the solar system.  I hold that \u2014 given my experience \u2014 I was more justified in my belief than anyone who claims that men playing against women for the World Cup would be unfair. All it takes is trusting that people believe what they say over and over for decades across all of society, and getting all your evidence about reality filtered through those same people. Which is actually not very hard.]\n                        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1904965261868085676 [2025-03-26] @imperialauditor \n                            super excited to read this book!! cc @DefenderOfBasic @nosilverv \n                            \n                            https://t.co/bcyGj9H6lJ\n                              [Quoting @nayafia: I wrote a new book!

Beginning with early musings on attention and reading, the thread crystallizes with @reasonisfun\u2019s 2018 tweet that defines self\u2011discipline, then expands through @visakanv\u2019s commentary. Over the years the discourse deepens into dialectical exchanges about coercive versus non\u2011coercive productivity, culminating in a mature, actionable model that emphasizes intrinsic motivation, supportive context, and the avoidance of self\u2011coercion. The narrative arc is sustained by a tight community of interlocutors who refine, test, and disseminate these ideas, creating a high\u2011utility, highly cohesive strand.",

(also that any individual tweet can itself be a QT!) \n\nwhat this means is that it\u2019s worth learning how to write threads in such a way that every individual tweet stands somewhat on its own, and makes sense and says something comprehensible even when RT\u2019d / QT\u2019d outside the context of the rest of the thread. ideally (imo) each tweet in a thread should make exactly one point or introduce exactly one new idea - they get very cluttered if you try to say too much at once. the thread as a whole serves as a journey through the individual ideas or points in each tweet, and can also offer detours via QTs to other threads. one of the cool things learning how to thread like this does is that you can be surprised by which tweets in a thread resonate with other people - maybe you had a grand conclusion but it\u2019s a throwaway tweet in the middle that people actually RT and QT and reply to. this is a level of granularity of feedback on your writing and ideas that longform doesn\u2019t support by default (although google doc comments can be even more granular, eg) and i\u2019ve learned a lot from it\n\nfrom this perspective long tweets offer a return back to longform, but somewhat more casual longform than eg a \u2018stack post. sometimes you wanna describe an idea that takes longer than 280 chars to meaningfully express. sometimes you wanna ramble and think out loud in a less structured way than a thread (this is what i\u2019m doing rn). threads also have the disadvantage that if you do too good a job making the individual tweets stand alone then when they get RT\u2019d and QT\u2019d they may not even look like part of a thread, so people may not even click through to the rest of it. long tweets have the advantage (and disadvantage) that the whole thing is RT\u2019d or QT\u2019d at once, meaning it\u2019s harder to single out individual bits but the whole package gets transported around twitter together, and unlike an external link it\u2019s all still happening on twitter. typically when i write long threads the first tweet gets RT\u2019d and QT\u2019d the most and all the numbers drop off from there. so i\u2019m interested in the ability of long tweets to preserve what might otherwise be a chopped-up thread as more of an organic whole. anyway that\u2019s what i\u2019ve got so far, time to get some food now. thanks for reading\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 1755072676811685951 [2024-02-07] @QiaochuYuan \ud83d\udc9c 16\n    kinda wish this was a thread, the stuff in the middle about threading would be worth having in its own separate tweets so i could QT it later, and also it would've been nice to be able to QT the strategy guide\n    \n    https://t.co/0fFpE2XKRL\n      [Quoting @visakanv: twitter_rpg_strategy_guide.txt]\n\n1798422482845901020 [2024-06-05] @vividvoid \ud83d\udc9c 312 \ud83d\udd01 2\nWhat are the great load-bearing TPOT posts?
